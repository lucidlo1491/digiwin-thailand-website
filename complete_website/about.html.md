## We Power Manufacturing's Digital Future

DigiWin exists to help manufacturers see clearly, act decisively, and grow confidently. For over four decades, we've been singularly focused on one thing: making factory operations visible, predictable, and profitable.

We don't serve banks, retailers, or hospitals. We serve the shop floor—the engineers tracking BOMs, the planners scheduling production runs, the operators monitoring OEE in real time. This focus isn't a marketing position. It's our DNA.

Every line of code we write, every consultant we train, every implementation we deliver is designed for one outcome: helping manufacturers compete and win.

Today, we're transforming from a software vendor into an AI infrastructure provider. Backed by 1,600+ R&D engineers and 1,800+ implementation consultants, DigiWin has developed 168 AI Agents and 68 operational SOPs to standardize and accelerate digital transformation. DigiWin is pioneering the Zhuge Platform — where AI doesn't just report on your factory, it helps run it.

OUR PHILOSOPHY 

## What We Believe

BELIEF 01 

### "Manufacturing Is Not Generic"

We don't sell to banks, retailers, or hospitals. We are manufacturing-only because the factory floor demands it. BOMs, routings, work orders, OEE—these aren't features we added; they're why we exist.

BELIEF 02 

### "Grow Together, Not Apart"

Our product suite—iGP → T100 → MES → WMS → AIoT—means your ERP partner doesn't change as your business scales. Your investment compounds, never resets. From 20-person workshop to multi-site enterprise group.

BELIEF 03 

### "Local Roots, Global Standards"

Our Thailand team speaks Thai, understands Thai business culture, and is backed by 44 years of global manufacturing expertise. We're not a remote vendor sending consultants from overseas—we're here.

BELIEF 04 

### "Data Should Liberate, Not Complicate"

We turn factory chaos—shadow Excel, ghost inventory, disconnected systems—into clear, actionable intelligence. Your production manager shouldn't need 3 spreadsheets to answer a simple question.

![Team collaborating in modern manufacturing workspace]

## Because of DigiWin, You Can...

### See Your Factory in Real Time

MES and AIoT give you live production data, not yesterday's spreadsheet. Know what's happening now, not what happened last shift.

### Control Costs Before They Control You

Material tracking, scrap reduction, yield optimization across every production run. See waste before it becomes loss.

### Ship On Time, Every Time

Production scheduling and WMS working together to meet customer delivery promises. No more expediting chaos.

### Scale Without Starting Over

One ecosystem from workshop to enterprise group. Add MES when you're ready, add WMS when you need it. Your foundation stays solid.

### Pass BOI Audits with Confidence

Production-order-level material reconciliation that matches exactly what the BOI board audits. One client saved 10M+ THB/year in supplementary taxes. Thai Revenue Department certified, with full traceability and audit trails built into every process.

### Make Decisions with Confidence

BI dashboards and analytics that turn raw data into strategic clarity. See the patterns, not just the numbers.

PROVEN IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD 

## Thailand Commitment

Real support, no translation needed. You are not the "guinea pig."

Since 2017 
Serving Thai Manufacturers 

DigiWin entered Thailand in 2017, initially serving Taiwanese and Chinese manufacturers who had set up operations here. As demand grew, we formally registered our Thai company in 2019 and built a local team from the ground up—hiring Thai consultants, learning Thai business culture, and building relationships with Thai factory owners. Today, we serve the Thai local market directly with 50+ team members. We're not a remote vendor sending consultants from overseas. We're your neighbor.
