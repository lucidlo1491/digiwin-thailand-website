## Thailand: ASEAN's Detroit

Thailand produces **1.9 million vehicles annually**, making it the largest automotive manufacturing hub in Southeast Asia. Behind every vehicle are **2,500+ tier 1-3 suppliers** facing relentless demands: perfect quality, complete traceability, and JIT delivery windows measured in hours, not days. DigiWin has spent 20+ years helping these suppliers meet—and exceed—OEM expectations.

## The Automotive Stakes Are High

In automotive, there's no room for "good enough"

### JIT or Else

Miss one delivery window and the OEM stops the line. The penalty isn't a warning—it's the cost of that downtime, plus losing the contract entirely.

### Trace or Lose

A quality issue surfaces. OEM asks: which lot? Which raw materials? Which operator? If you can't answer in hours, you're not a tier-1 supplier anymore.

### Audit Anxiety

IATF 16949. Customer audits quarterly. Documentation requirements that keep growing. Manual systems simply can't keep up.
