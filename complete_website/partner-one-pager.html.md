# What If Your License MarginsWere 62–70%?

The Money — What One Deal Puts in Your Pocket 

Sample Deal 
ERP + MES License: *฿3M* 
200-employee factory · illustrative 

฿1.86–2.1M 
License Margin 
62–70% of list price at **Golden tier**. You sell at list, keep the spread. 

100% 
Implementation 
Consulting, training, customization, go-live. **You set the rate. You keep it all.** 

Spread 
Maintenance 
Charge clients 15–20%/yr. Pay DigiWin 12%. **You keep the difference.** Year 1 free for client. 

5–10% 
Referral Fee 
Not ready to implement? Just make the intro. **We close, you earn.** 

Maintenance revenue compounds: each client adds **(Your Rate − 12%) × License Value** annually. With **95% renewal rate**, your base grows every year — revenue that stacks, not resets. 

How You Win — The Reverse Cut 
Don't sell ERP. Sell *visibility* first. 

Lead with MES 
Show the factory their own shop floor data. Faster decision — weeks, not months. Lower risk entry. 
Quick win 


The Gap Reveals Itself 
MES runs the floor. But finance, procurement, planning are still on spreadsheets. The client sees the disconnect. 
Client pulls you in 


Expand to Full ERP 
Natural upsell — not a cold pitch. The client asks you for it. Add WMS, AIoT as they grow. 
Deal size 3–5× 

*You bring the relationships. We bring the technology.* You don't need to become a software company — you need to bring your clients and your industry knowledge. We handle the rest. 

Why DigiWin — Not the Others 

Manufacturing-Native 
Built for factories from day 1 — not accounting software adapted for manufacturing. BOM, MES, WMS, AIoT in **one integrated stack.** 

Thai RD + BOI Certified 
Only 2 foreign ERP vendors hold both certifications. One factory faced **฿10M+ BOI penalty** without compliant systems. 

7 Accounting Firm Partners 
Already referring factory clients into our network. **Built-in pipeline** for new partners — not starting from zero. 

The Window Is Now 
Competitors scaling to 20+ staff each in Thailand. Compliance demand rising. **Early movers get territory.** 

Your Safety Net 

Pay-When-Paid 
You pay DigiWin only after your client pays you. Zero cash flow risk. 

Channel Protection 
Your accounts are your accounts. DigiWin doesn't compete with its own partners. 

Training Included 
Product certification + sales methodology. We invest in your team's readiness. 

No Minimum 
Start with one client. Prove the model. Scale when you're ready. 

Who To Target — Your Ideal First Clients 

Thai-Owned Factories 
50–500 employees. Pure Thai ownership — **not Chinese-invested.** They need Thai RD compliance and local-language support. 

Outgrown Excel or Legacy ERP 
Manual processes, disconnected systems. They know they need to upgrade — they just haven't found the right partner yet. 

Facing BOI / Thai RD Deadlines 
Government compliance crackdown is real. One factory faced **฿10M+ penalty.** Urgency = faster close for you.
