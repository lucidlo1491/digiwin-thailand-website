For Manufacturing Business Owners

# Your True Costs Are Invisible.

"Shadow Excel" files have replaced your standard operating procedures. Ghost inventory means system says 100, shelf says 50. We fix this—because we've spent 44 years doing nothing but manufacturing software.

## Trapped in the Man-Day Model?

Your revenue is capped by headcount. Customization wars burn out your best consultants. We offer a way out—product-based margins that compound instead of compress.

For Manufacturing Business Owners

## Do You Recognize These Problems?

If any of these sound familiar, you're not alone. These are the most common problems we solve for factories across Thailand and Asia.

01 

### "Shadow Excel" Reality

"You know your factory isn't actually running on your current system—it's running on spreadsheets because your staff finds the software too rigid or slow."

Your real operations live in unconnected Excel files, not in your ERP. Financial data doesn't match physical reality because planners work outside the system.

02 

### "The Black Box" Problem

"You know exactly how much raw material you bought and how many finished goods you sold, but the 3 weeks in between — your work in progress — are invisible."

You rely on paper reports filled out yesterday to understand what happened today. You can't see what's happening on the floor right now without walking over and asking.

03 

### "Ghost Inventory" Crisis

"The system says you have 100 units, but the shelf has 50. This discrepancy forces your team to hoard 'safety stock' just to survive."

Inventory inaccuracy ties up millions in unnecessary capital and destroys your ability to promise reliable delivery dates. The "borrowing culture" has replaced discipline.

04 

### "Cost Guesswork" Trap

"You quoted a price last month based on estimated costs. This month the same product costs 15% more to make — and you have no idea why."

Batch-to-batch cost fluctuations are invisible without production-order-level tracking. You're pricing based on last quarter's averages, not this morning's reality.

05 

### "10-Second Answer" Failure

"When your biggest customer calls and asks 'where is my order?' — you put them on hold, walk to the shop floor, and hope someone knows."

Real-time delivery status should be a click away, not a 20-minute investigation. Every hold costs you credibility with the customers who matter most.

For ERP Implementers

## Trapped in These Cycles?

The consulting model has structural limits. Recognizing these traps is the first step to escaping them.

01 

### "The Man-Day Trap"

"Your revenue is mathematically capped by your headcount. You cannot grow your top line without proportionally increasing your payroll costs."

You are selling hours, not assets. Revenue = Hours Worked, making exponential growth impossible. Every January, you start at zero again.

02 

### "Customization Death Spiral"

"You accept customization requests to win the deal, but then you become married to that code forever."

You can't upgrade clients on custom code. Support becomes a nightmare of unbillable hours. Your profit evaporated the moment you said "Yes" to a non-standard request.

03 

### "The Ghost IT Burden"

"You aren't just their ERP consultant—you are their unpaid IT department, fixing Wi-Fi, printers, and user discipline issues."

Most Thai SMEs lack a dedicated IT manager. You end up subsidizing their operations with your margins — absorbing unbillable work you feel forced to do just to keep the relationship alive.

- Component-level traceability

- MSD (Moisture Sensitivity Device) management

- AOI (Automated Optical Inspection) integration and defect tracking

[Explore Electronics Solutions](industries/electronics.html)

### Metal & Plastics Processing

Stamping, injection molding, CNC machining. Process manufacturing where yield optimization and scrap reduction drive your margins.

- Process parameter monitoring

- Mold/die lifecycle management

- Scrap analysis and reduction

- Cycle time optimization

Why Trust DigiWin

## Credibility Without Hype

We don't just claim to be different. Here's the evidence.

300378 

### Financial Stability

We are a publicly traded company with transparent financials—the stability partners and clients need for a 10-year relationship.

Our financials are publicly audited and regulated by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. That means you're partnering with a company that has the governance, capital, and long-term commitment to support your factory for years to come — not a vendor that might disappear after implementation.

Foxconn FII 

### Manufacturing DNA

Strategic investment from Foxconn Industrial Internet — validation that our software meets the standards of the world's largest electronics manufacturer.

This isn't generic IT software — it's built for industrial reality. When the company that manufactures iPhones trusts DigiWin on their production lines, that speaks to the depth and reliability of our platform at the highest level of manufacturing complexity.

Since 1982 

### Manufacturing Focus Since Day One

We have spent 44 years exclusively in manufacturing software—built on decades of shop-floor reality, not temporary tech trends.

DigiWin has survived every technology shift (DOS → Windows → Cloud) while staying focused on manufacturing. We didn't pivot to crypto or retail POS when it was trendy.

50,000+ 

### Proven at Scale

Our methodology is refined from 50,000+ implementations across Asia—adopt a proven standard, not a beta product.

The software has been refined through thousands of real-world factory deployments across Asia. It handles the specific complexities — Thai tax rules, sub-contracting workflows, circular bills of materials — that often break smaller systems.

BOI Ready 

### BOI Compliance

Production-order-level material reconciliation that passes BOI (Board of Investment) audits — a capability no competitor can match.

One factory saved 10M+ THB/year in supplementary taxes. Our system tracks actual material consumption per production order, not theoretical bill-of-materials calculations — the gap that triggers costly audit findings. [Read the full story ](blog/boi-compliance-jin-hai.html)
