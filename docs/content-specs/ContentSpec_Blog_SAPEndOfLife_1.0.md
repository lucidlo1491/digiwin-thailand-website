### Opening / Hook

SAP ECC (ERP Central Component) — the system that thousands of manufacturers worldwide have relied on for decades — is approaching end of mainstream maintenance in 2027. For Thai manufacturers running SAP ECC, this creates a forced decision point. Migrate to S/4HANA (expensive, complex, disruptive) or evaluate alternatives.

This is not a sudden development. The timeline has been known for years. But for many mid-sized manufacturers in Thailand, the reality is only now becoming urgent. Extended support is available, but at premium pricing. More importantly, the practical implications of staying on a declining platform — security patch concerns, integration compatibility issues with newer systems, reduced vendor support — mean that the decision window is narrowing.

---

### Section 1: What "End of Life" Actually Means

- SAP ECC doesn't stop working overnight when mainstream maintenance ends in 2027
- But trajectory changes fundamentally:
  - No new feature development → progressively less capable
  - Reduced support → longer resolution times
  - Security patch concerns → vulnerabilities deprioritized
- **Integration compatibility** is the most insidious challenge — as other systems evolve, maintaining connectors to ECC becomes increasingly difficult; vendors prioritize current platforms
- Extended maintenance available through 2030, but at **premium pricing** — financial drain that doesn't deliver new capabilities
- Practical reality: current SAP investment enters declining trajectory

**Data card:**
- 2027: SAP ECC End of Mainstream Maintenance
- Extended support available until 2030 at premium pricing

### Section 2: The S/4HANA Migration Challenge

- SAP's prescribed path: migrate to S/4HANA
- **S/4HANA is not an upgrade — it is a complete reimplementation**
  - Different data model, user interface, technical architecture
  - Cannot simply "upgrade" — must reimplement
- Timeline: measured in **years, not months**
  - Data migration, process redesign, customization redevelopment, testing, training
  - Every custom report, integration, workflow needs rebuild/replacement
- **Cost often exceeds the original ECC implementation**
  - Original SAP chosen for enterprise credibility and brand recognition
  - Spending comparable amounts for staying in same ecosystem raises ROI questions

**Highlight box:** "Limited Thai localization depth: While S/4HANA has broad global capabilities, manufacturing-specific features that Thai factories depend on — BOI compliance reconciliation, Thai Revenue Department reporting formats, multi-currency handling for duty-free imports — often require additional customization. The out-of-box Thai localization focuses primarily on financial compliance, not manufacturing operations."

- Many Thai manufacturers caught: too invested to walk away, but migration may cost more than original deployment with limited incremental manufacturing value

### Section 3: The Alternative Path

- Transition period creates natural evaluation window
- When forced to make significant change anyway, switching costs become comparable
- Question shifts: "can we afford to change?" → "which change delivers better outcomes?"
- Honest assessment questions:
  - Does current system provide manufacturing-specific capabilities (co-product costing, capacity planning with finite scheduling, production-order-level BOI reconciliation) as built-in features?
  - Or have you been working around manufacturing gaps with spreadsheets, manual processes, external tools?
- For many: SAP ECC chosen for brand recognition, not because purpose-built for manufacturing
  - Excels at financial management and enterprise resource coordination
  - Shop floor scheduling, material consumption tracking at production order level, co-product costing in process manufacturing — areas where generic enterprise systems struggle

**Pull quote:** "The question isn't whether to move off SAP ECC. The question is whether to migrate to S/4HANA or to a system that was built for manufacturing from the ground up."

- Landscape has changed — manufacturing-focused ERP with same enterprise breadth now available with decades of proven implementations

### Section 4: What to Look For in an Alternative

Five evaluation criteria:

1. **Manufacturing-native capabilities, not bolted on:**
   - Capacity planning with machine constraints and sequence-dependent setup times
   - Co-product costing for multi-output processes
   - Material consumption tracked at production order level (not theoretical BOM calculation)

2. **Thai compliance built in, not customized later:**
   - BOI reconciliation reports at production-order-level material consumption
   - Thai Revenue Department reporting formats as standard outputs
   - Multi-currency handling for duty-free import scenarios

3. **AMRP with capacity planning, not requiring separate APS:**
   - Material requirements planning considering finite capacity (machine hours, labor, tooling)
   - Integrated, not requiring separate Advanced Planning System

4. **Multi-site architecture for growing operations:**
   - Handle multiple sites as native capability
   - Not through data replication workarounds

5. **Proven Thai implementation track record:**
   - 100+ manufacturing implementations in Thailand
   - Full range of industries (automotive, food processing, electronics, plastics)
   - System should have encountered and solved problems you face

### Section 5: The Opportunity in Forced Change

- Forced change is disruptive but creates opportunity
- Switching costs (data migration, process redesign, retraining) are unavoidable regardless of destination
- Only variable: what you get in return
- For manufacturers living with SAP's manufacturing limitations:
  - Spreadsheets for production planning (MRP doesn't consider capacity)
  - Separate BOI filing systems (ERP can't track at production order level)
  - Inaccurate product costs (co-product allocation requires manual workarounds)
- This is the moment to evaluate purpose-built manufacturing ERP

**Highlight box:** "44 years of manufacturing focus. 50,000+ implementations globally. 100+ Thai factories. DigiWin has spent four decades building ERP systems specifically for manufacturing operations. T100 is not a general-purpose system adapted for manufacturing — it is a manufacturing system that includes enterprise capabilities. Worth a conversation if you are facing the SAP ECC transition decision."

### Section 6: Closing — Not a Crisis, A Catalyst

- 2027 deadline is not a crisis — it's a catalyst
- For years, "good enough" prevailed because cost/risk of change outweighed benefits
- When change is forced, calculus shifts entirely
- Decision: migrate to S/4HANA and continue same ecosystem, or evaluate manufacturing-native ERP
- Extended maintenance ends 2030, but decision should be driven by best outcome for next decade, not deadlines alone
- The workarounds (capacity in spreadsheets, BOI in separate systems, scheduling by experience) don't need to remain your reality

## Data Claims & Stats Used

| Claim | Source/Verification |
|-------|-------------------|
| SAP ECC end of mainstream maintenance in 2027 | **Verified** — SAP announced end of mainstream maintenance for ECC 6.0 in 2027 |
| Extended support available through 2030 | **Verified** — SAP extended maintenance option through 2030 at premium pricing |
| S/4HANA migration "cost often exceeds the original ECC implementation" | Industry-general claim, directionally correct for complex migrations; not precisely sourced |
| "44 years of manufacturing focus" | Consistent with cross-checked data (DigiWin founded ~1982) |
| "50,000+ implementations globally" | Consistent with cross-checked data |
| "100+ Thai factories" | Consistent with cross-checked data ("100+ Thai implementations") |
| "T100" named as the product | Product name verified from source documents |
| S/4HANA migration takes "years, not months" | Industry-general claim, directionally correct for mid-to-large migrations |
| SAP ECC "chosen for brand recognition and enterprise credibility" | Positioning claim — editorially reasonable but subjective |
| "Only 2 foreign ERP vendors" with Thai RD certification | **NOT claimed in this article** (good — this was flagged as unverified in cross-check) |

## Flags & Notes

- **This is a competitive positioning article targeting SAP users.** It follows the PRD constraint "Never name competitors directly" — however, SAP is named extensively as the article is about SAP ECC end-of-life specifically. This is editorially justified because the article addresses a real market event (SAP ECC EOL) rather than making competitive claims. The article is careful not to disparage SAP directly — it frames the issue as "generic enterprise ERP vs. manufacturing-native ERP."
- **DigiWin and T100 are named explicitly** in the closing highlight box. This is more direct product placement than other blog articles which remain vendor-neutral. The placement is in a clearly demarcated highlight box, which is appropriate.
- **"show you what a manufacturing-native alternative looks like" in CTA** — borders on demo language but is acceptable since it's framed as an evaluation conversation.
- **Related article links to `amrp-capacity-planning.html`** — need to verify this file exists. If not, this violates the "Real Links Only" constraint.
- **Thai localization claims** (BOI reconciliation, Thai RD reporting formats as standard) are product-specific claims that should be verified against actual T100 capabilities.
- **Strong strategic angle** — Article successfully positions the SAP EOL deadline as an opportunity rather than a crisis, which aligns with the Playbook's persuasion approach for Track A (factory operators).
- **No OEE, MES, WMS jargon concerns** — Article focuses on ERP-level terminology (BOM, MRP, APS, AMRP) which is appropriate for the audience (current SAP users who would be familiar with these terms).
- **BOI compliance mentioned as a key differentiator** — consistent with cross-checked finding that BOI compliance is the #1 sales driver.
