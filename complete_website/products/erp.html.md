## What is ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)?

**DigiWin ERP** is a manufacturing-specific Enterprise Resource Planning system born from 44 years of serving factories across Taiwan, China, and Southeast Asia — regions where manufacturing isn't just an industry, it's the backbone of the economy. Available in two editions — **T100** for enterprise-scale multi-site operations (200+ employees) and **iGP** for growing single-site manufacturers (20–200 employees) — it provides real-time financial control, BOM (Bill of Materials) management, MRP (Material Requirements Planning) and LRP (Lot Requirements Planning), quality management, and complete production traceability. Backed by 50,000+ factory clients and 1,500+ R&D engineers, DigiWin is the most widely deployed manufacturing ERP in Greater China and Southeast Asia — now serving Thai manufacturers directly with a full local team.

## Manufacturing Challenges, Solved

Generic ERP wasn't built for factories. These problems disappear when your system understands manufacturing.

The Problem

### "We don't know our true costs until month-end"

Standard cost variance buried in accounting entries. Material waste discovered weeks after production. No visibility into real-time margin.

DigiWin Solution

#### Real-Time Cost Visibility

Actual cost calculated at each production stage. Margin visibility before you ship, not after you invoice.

The Problem

### "MRP gives us garbage because our BOMs are outdated"

Engineering changes happen on the floor, not in the system. BOM versions scattered across spreadsheets.

DigiWin Solution

#### Engineering Change Control

Engineering Change Notice (ECN) workflow ensures changes are captured before production. MRP always runs against current, approved BOMs.

The Problem

### "Inventory count never matches the system"

Ghost inventory haunts every audit. Production consumes materials that don't exist. Purchasing reorders what you already have.

DigiWin Solution

#### Transaction-Level Accuracy

Every material movement captured at source. Barcode scanning enforced at key points. Cycle counting built in.

The Problem

### "We can't trace quality issues back to their source"

Customer complaints trigger panic investigations. Lot numbers exist somewhere, maybe. Root cause analysis takes weeks.

DigiWin Solution

#### Complete Traceability

Lot tracking from receiving to shipping. One click shows full genealogy. Quality data linked to batches, machines, operators.

What Sets DigiWin Apart

## 7 Technical Advantages Built for Real Factories

These aren't minor features — they're fundamental architectural capabilities that address real Thai manufacturing challenges.

### Advanced Material Requirements Planning

AMRP

Capacity planning built directly into the ERP. Schedule production based on actual machine capacity, material availability, and labor constraints — all calculated in one system.

Many enterprise ERP systems require a separate advanced planning system (APS) purchase for this capability.

### Co-Product Accounting

Multi-Output Work Orders

One work order produces multiple outputs with accurate cost allocation per product. Essential for plastics injection, food processing, and chemical manufacturing.

Most competing ERP systems cannot handle co-product work orders without costly customization.

### Lot Requirements Planning

LRP

Calculate material requirements for a specific production order in under one minute. No waiting hours for a full MRP run to answer "can we accept this order?"

Accept or decline orders with confidence — while the customer is still on the phone.

### Dual Unit Tracking

Simultaneous UOM Display

Display and track both weight (kg) and quantity (pieces) simultaneously across all transactions. No conversions, no rounding errors, no confusion.

Most mid-market ERP systems can only display one unit of measure at a time.

### Shop Floor Mini-Scheduling

Real-Time Floor Adjustments

Floor supervisors adjust production schedules in real-time, and changes are immediately visible to planning. Bridge the gap between the plan and reality.

This bidirectional floor-to-planning visibility is rare in mid-market ERP.

### Feature Codes

Multi-Dimension Variants

Manage product variants across up to 3 dimensions (color, size, grade) under a single item code. Turn 27 SKUs into 1 manageable product with full traceability.

Reduces item master complexity by 90%+ for variant-heavy manufacturers.

### BOI (Board of Investment) Reconciliation

Production-Order-Level Tracking

Track actual material consumption at the production order level — not theoretical BOM calculations. Generate BOI-ready reports that match what the Board of Investment audits.

No competitor offers production-order-level BOI material reconciliation.

Proven Results

### From 10M THB/Year to Zero in Supplementary Taxes

When the BOI audited one of our clients, DigiWin's production-order-level reconciliation showed exact material consumption — no gaps, no guesswork. The result: supplementary taxes dropped from over 10 million baht annually to zero.

### BOI 2026: Enforcement Is Getting Serious

The Board of Investment is cracking down on four areas that directly affect your factory:

- 1 **Double bookkeeping detection** Separate systems for BOI vs non-BOI transactions are being flagged. A single integrated system eliminates the risk.

- 2 **Inventory mismatch audits** Physical vs. system stock discrepancies trigger investigations. WMS barcode scanning and cycle counting deliver 95%+ accuracy.

- 3 **BOI/non-BOI transaction filing** Incorrect categorization can lead to privilege revocation. Production-order-level tracking separates BOI from non-BOI transactions automatically.

- 4 **Tariff recovery actions** Non-compliant imports face retroactive duty collection. A full audit trail from receiving to shipping gives you BOI-ready reports on demand.

## Frequently Asked Questions

What is the difference between T100 and iGP? + 

T100 is DigiWin's enterprise-tier ERP designed for manufacturers with 200+ employees, multiple sites, and complex multi-company structures. iGP (also known as Workflow ERP) is the growth-tier ERP for single-site manufacturers with 20–200 employees, offering modular purchasing and faster 3–6 month deployments. Both share the same manufacturing DNA and can scale — many customers start with iGP and upgrade to T100 as they grow.

Is DigiWin ERP certified for Thai tax and BOI compliance? + 

Yes. DigiWin ERP is certified by the Thai Revenue Department for e-Tax filing and includes built-in withholding tax (WHT) workflows, VAT handling, and BOI (Board of Investment) compliance features. The system tracks actual material consumption at the production order level — not theoretical BOM calculations — so your BOI reports match what auditors expect. One customer eliminated over 10 million THB per year in supplementary tax penalties after switching to DigiWin.

How long does a DigiWin ERP implementation take? + 

iGP implementations typically take 3–6 months for a single-site factory. T100 enterprise implementations take 6–9 months for multi-site operations, which is significantly faster than comparable enterprise ERPs (often 12–18 months). This speed comes from DigiWin's pre-built manufacturing templates refined across 50,000+ factory deployments and 44 years of process knowledge — you're not starting from scratch.

How does DigiWin ERP compare to SAP, Oracle, or Infor for manufacturing? + 

DigiWin ERP delivers approximately 90% of Tier-1 ERP capability at roughly 70% of the cost, with significantly faster implementation timelines. Unlike horizontal ERPs that serve banks, retailers, and hospitals, DigiWin is built exclusively for manufacturing — with native support for Bill of Materials (BOM) management, shop floor scheduling, quality control, and production costing. These are capabilities that other ERPs typically require expensive customization to achieve, often adding months to the project.

Does DigiWin ERP integrate with MES, WMS, and AIoT? + 

Yes. All DigiWin products — ERP, MES (Manufacturing Execution System), WMS (Warehouse Management System), and AIoT — are built on the same platform with one shared database. This means no integration middleware or manual reconciliation: production data flows from shop floor machines through MES into ERP financials automatically. When you add a module, it connects instantly because it already shares the same data source.
