## What is MES (Manufacturing Execution System)?

A Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is software that monitors, tracks, and controls production on the factory floor in real time, bridging the gap between ERP planning and shop floor execution. It gives manufacturers instant visibility into what is happening at every workstation and work order — replacing paper logs and delayed reports with live data.

**DigiWin MES** provides this real-time visibility for factories in Thailand. Through three tiers — **MES** for full production execution, **SFT** (Shop Floor Tracking) for mid-tier tracking, and **AIoT Cloud** for entry-level monitoring — it tracks work orders, calculates OEE in real time, captures quality data at every station, and maintains complete lot-level traceability. Start anywhere and upgrade as your factory matures.

## The Transformation

From shop floor chaos to real-time clarity

Before MES 

"Where's that order?" 
Walk the floor, ask around, hope someone knows. Hours to find answers. 

Yesterday's data 
Production reports arrive after problems already happened. Always reacting. 

Traceability panic 
Quality issue? Days of paper-digging to find which batch, which lot, which operator. 

OEE guesswork 
Downtime tracking on whiteboards. No one trusts the numbers. 


With DigiWin MES 

Order location in one click 
Which station, what operation, estimated completion—instant answers. 

Real-time dashboards 
Live production rates, quality alerts, downtime notifications. Prevent problems. 

Complete traceability 
Full genealogy from receiving to shipping. One click shows everything. 

Accurate OEE 
Automatic calculation from machine data. Real numbers you can trust. 

## Three Paths to Shop Floor Visibility

Choose the level that matches your needs and budget. Start anywhere — upgrade anytime.

- ✓ Production status dashboard

- ✓ Mobile app access

- ✓ Subscription pricing (no upfront)

- ✓ Cloud deployment (no servers)

Best For 
Low initial investment, simple equipment monitoring, factories testing digitalization before committing 

AIoT Cloud 
Starting your digitalization journey. Small factories, quick start, subscription pricing. 

SFT 
Need production transparency. Mid-size operations, structured tracking, fast deployment. 

MES 
Full manufacturing execution. Complex operations, multi-plant, complete traceability. 

### Already Have an ERP?

MES connects to any ERP system through standard web services. See your shop floor clearly without changing your existing ERP. When you're ready to upgrade, we're here.

## What You Can See—Right Now

Real-time visibility into every aspect of production

### Order Location

Which workstation? What operation? How long until complete?

### Production Rate

Units per hour vs. target. By line, product, shift.

### Quality Issues

Defects as they happen. By type, station, operator.

### Downtime

What's stopped? Why? For how long? Trends over time.

### Labor Efficiency

Actual vs. standard time. By operator, by operation.

### Material Usage

What's being consumed? Variance from standard?

### OEE Metrics

Availability, performance, quality—calculated automatically.

### Traceability

Full genealogy. Lot, serial, components, operators.

## Frequently Asked Questions

What is a Manufacturing Execution System (MES)? + 

A Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is software that tracks, monitors, and controls production on the factory floor in real time. It bridges the gap between ERP planning and actual shop floor execution — showing you what's happening on every machine and workstation right now, not what happened yesterday.

What is the difference between MES, SFT, and AIoT Cloud? + 

MES is DigiWin's full-featured manufacturing execution system for comprehensive production management — work order tracking, quality control, material traceability, and OEE analytics. SFT (Shop Floor Tracking) is a mid-tier option deployed in 2-4 weeks, focusing on production reporting and machine status monitoring. AIoT Cloud is the entry-level tier — cloud-based monitoring with mobile apps and subscription pricing. Many factories start with AIoT Cloud or SFT and expand to full MES as they mature.

Do I need ERP before implementing MES? + 

No. DigiWin MES connects to any existing ERP through standard web services. Many manufacturers start with MES first to get immediate shop floor visibility, then add or upgrade ERP later. This approach lets you see ROI faster than a full ERP replacement.

What results can I expect with DigiWin MES? + 

Based on implementation data across 50,000+ manufacturing clients, MES customers report a 45% reduction in production cycle time, 70% reduction in quality failures, and 26% improvement in operational efficiency. SFT users typically achieve 92% production transparency and 86% on-time delivery rate. Results vary by factory, but the visibility alone typically drives immediate behavioral improvements on the shop floor.

How does DigiWin MES connect to machines on the shop floor? + 

DigiWin MES connects to shop floor equipment through DigiWin's AIoT platform, which supports 50+ industrial protocols including OPC-UA, Modbus, MQTT, and direct CNC/PLC connections. For machines without digital interfaces, barcode scanning and tablet-based operator input provide the data bridge.
