## Partner Tiers & Revenue Model

### Three-Tier Dealer Classification System (from Master Agreement)

| Tier | Name | Capability | Revenue Model |
|------|------|-----------|---------------|
| **Gold** | Golden Level | Authorized to perform Sales **or** Delivery independently, without Digiwin's direct involvement | Full distributor pricing; keeps margin between distributor price and market list price |
| **Silver** | Silver Level | Works in collaboration with Digiwin to complete sales and delivery, developing independent capabilities over time | Collaborative pricing; shared revenue per Accessory Agreement |
| **Referral** | Referral Level | Introduction/referral only. Digiwin decides whether to accept the case, execute the contract, and complete delivery | Commission on license fees (see schedule below) |

### Referral Commission Schedule (from Referral Partner Agreement)

The Referral Partner Agreement specifies commission levels based on License Fee collected from the customer. The exact percentages are defined per Accessory Agreement but the structure is tiered by deal size. Commission is paid only on software produced by Digiwin (not third-party products or services).

**Payment Process:**
1. Both parties sign a confirmation letter of successful referral per customer
2. Party B issues a valid commission VAT invoice to Digiwin
3. Payment made after Digiwin receives confirmation letter and invoice

### Revenue Streams for Partners (from Website Brief)

- **Implementation/Consulting Services:** Partner signs directly with end client, keeps 100% of service revenue
- **Software Licensing:** Margin between distributor price and market list price
- **Recurring Revenue:** MA (Maintenance) service fees, version upgrades
- **Add-on Ecosystem:** IoT modules, eMES, WMS sold to existing client base (new revenue streams)
- **Referral Incentive:** Commission for introducing qualified leads for non-authorized products

### Key Revenue Messaging (from Website Brief)
> "Shift your revenue mix. Stop relying on one-off implementation fees. Build a sustainable practice with Digiwin's recurring revenue and add-on ecosystem."

**Term:** 1 year, auto-renewing unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal

**Sales Target:** Minimum 3 sales orders from 3 different end clients during the agreement period

**Termination Triggers:**

5. Demo licenses (1-year term, annually renewable, internal use + client demos only)
6. Pre-sale planning consultation and contract negotiation support
7. Customization services (when needed by end clients)

### Qualified Sales Lead Booking System

**Purpose:** Avoid market conflicts between distributors

**Booking Requirements (all must be submitted to Digiwin):**
- Company full name (from business registration)
- Contact person with name card
- Email and phone number
- Industry category, company size (employees + machines)
- Sales lead details: management issues, pain points, preliminary demand assessment

**Booking Rules:**
- Digiwin responds within 3 working days (approve or reject with reason)
- Initial booking period: 6 months
- One extension: additional 3 months
- After expiry: 1-month cooling period before rebooking
- Bookings are product-specific (different distributors can book same client for different products)
- Bi-weekly progress reviews required

**Booking Exclusions:**
- Digiwin's existing clients or prospects
- Already booked by another distributor
- Incomplete information
- Incompatible industry (e.g., trading/distribution, hotels)

### Branding Requirements

Partners must mark "Business Partner" caption when using Digiwin's brand name or logo in any external-facing materials (business cards, agreements, signs, emails, websites, etc.)

### Relationship

Partners are independent distributors, NOT agents or employees. Each party acts in its own name, at its own risk, for its own account.

## Real Partner Examples

### Kernel (First Signed Distributor)

- **Agreement:** HDDL-DD-MASTER-0001 (first distributor master agreement)
- **Effective Date:** 2025/12/01
- **Status:** Active distributor with signed Master Agreement
- **Significance:** Template/proof-of-concept for the distribution model; the Kernel agreement was the basis from which the template agreement was generalized

### Alfa Sistemi (Italian Consulting Firm)

**Company Profile:**
- Italian ERP consulting firm, 25+ years in business
- Strong presence in Italy and Europe
- Managing Director: Carli (30 years knowing Thailand, passionate about the market)
- Recently opened/expanded Thailand operations (office near TICC - Thai Italian Chamber of Commerce in Phrom Phong area)
- Member of TICC (Thai Italian Chamber of Commerce)
- Can sell licenses for SAP, Microsoft, and Oracle
- Deep knowledge across multiple ERPs: SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, Colafinancial (UK), Adonix (French), and others
- Has connections to European consulting network (exchanges leads with other consultants)

**Business Model with Digiwin (Proposed 3-Phase Approach from VP):**

| Phase | Model | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | Case-by-Case | Individual project referrals. Digiwin handles implementation. Alfa handles sales/European client relationship. Product sales support only. |
| Phase 2 | Distributor | Formal distribution agreement for Thailand/specific territories. Alfa does sales, installation, implementation, first-line service. Digiwin provides second-line service, version upgrades, enablement. |
| Phase 3 | Joint Venture | Potential JV company in other countries (to be explored) |

**Value Chain Split (from VP guidance):**
- Marketing & Selling: Alfa leads (European client relationships)
- Installation: Alfa (with Digiwin support initially)
- Implementation: Alfa (developing capability over time)
- Customer Service: Alfa handles first-line; Digiwin handles second-line
- Maintenance/Version Upgrades: Digiwin

**Alfa's Key Value Proposition:**
- Controls a large pool of European manufacturing clients expanding to Southeast Asia
- Clients with long relationships (10-15 years)
- Understands the "connector" business model: bridging headquarters ERP (SAP/Oracle) with local Digiwin ERP
- European clients' branches are manufacturing branches (B2B), not commercial
- Deep understanding of European corporate governance expectations

**Target End Customers (via Alfa):**
- European manufacturers opening branches in Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, etc.)
- Industries: automotive parts, home appliances (washing machines), motorbike parts (silencers), machine manufacturing
- Companies facing SAP ECC end-of-life in 2027 (forced migration to S4 HANA = opportunity)
- Branches that cannot justify full SAP/Oracle implementation costs

**The Connector Model:**
- Alfa develops connectors (API/JSON) between headquarters ERP (SAP/Oracle) and local Digiwin ERP
- Headquarters keeps existing system for corporate control, consolidation reports, financial oversight
- Branch uses Digiwin for local manufacturing operations, cost controlling, local compliance
- Connector ensures data flows back to headquarters BI tools
- First customer pays for connector development; subsequent customers benefit from lower costs

**Key Issues Identified:**
- Language barrier: Digiwin cannot handle Italian/European languages directly
- Local regulation fulfillment is the #1 value driver (tax, legal, compliance)
- Remote monitoring/consolidation for headquarters is #2 value driver
- Cost of flying European consultants to Thailand is prohibitive
- European corporate culture demands clarity and transparency before project start

### Nexus (SAP Partner - Failed Attempt)

- Thailand's largest SAP partner
- Partnership attempt stalled and faded away
- Reason: Complex Japanese ownership structure causing endless approval delays

### Other Partnership Attempts (2025)

- General "outsourcing partner" model attempted in 2025
- Failed due to: Digiwin could not generate enough project volume to "feed" partners
- Partners lost interest without immediate profit or cases to work on

---

## Channel Strategy Evolution

### 2025: The "Outsourcing" Experiment (Failed)

**Model:** Digiwin generates leads, feeds projects to partners who earn revenue through delivery/implementation services only.

**Why It Failed:**
1. **Lead Starvation:** Internal team lacked sufficient project volume to feed partners
2. **Dependency:** Model relied entirely on Digiwin providing work; unsustainable
3. **Capability Gap:** Partners (like Alfa) preferred referrals only rather than deep Digiwin product learning

### 2026: The "International & Platform" Pivot

**Revenue Target:** 10M THB for the channel (10x scale-up from 2025)

**Strategic Shifts:**

1. **Non-Typical International Channels:** Target European and US software vendors (Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Czechia) whose clients are moving manufacturing to Southeast Asia. These vendors have the clients but lack local Asian compliance capabilities.

2. **"Road Show" Strategy:** Fly prospective distributors to Taiwan or Shanghai to see headquarters, manufacturing bases, and AIoT showrooms. Overcomes the "Trust Gap" where Digiwin appears small in a Bangkok office.

3. **AI-Enabled Delivery ("Central Kitchen"):** Deploy "Digiwin Partner" platform and AI Agents. Provide "pre-cooked" assets (AI tools, templates) so partners can deliver complex projects with lower-skilled staff. Eliminates the "Master-Apprentice" bottleneck.

4. **Local Ecosystem & Associations:** Expand into industry associations (IoT, Metal, Plastics) to generate leads that can be fed to partners, fixing the 2025 supply issue.

### VP's Three Critical Concerns

1. **"Begging" vs. "Attracting":** If the business model is truly profitable, partners should be eager to join. "If we have to beg them, the starting point is wrong."

2. **The "Outsourcing" Trap:** Partners must generate their own value or serve their existing clientele, not just wait for Digiwin to feed them.

3. **Capability Gap:** Product learning threshold (Workflow/T100) is too high. Solution: AI and Templates, not "Master-Apprentice" methods. "I don't just give you Office; I give you the financial report template."

## Website Brief Requirements

### Target Persona: "Khun Somchai" (Ideal Distributor Profile)

**Demographics:**
- CEO/Founder/Managing Director of mid-sized ERP consultancy
- Industrial Engineering background, now focused on P&L management
- ~25 years experience
- Bangkok HQ with operations across EEC (Eastern Economic Corridor)
- Company: 35-45 staff boutique firm

**Core Conflict (The Wedge):**
- Margin erosion: clients demand Tier-1 capabilities for Tier-3 prices; scope creep eating profits
- Talent drain: expensive senior consultants utilized for low-value tasks (data cleaning)
- Competitive threat: Chinese principals (Kingdee, Yonyou) entering Thailand with lower prices and modern tech

**What Resonates (Do's):**
- Speak "ROI" and "Scalability" -- how Digiwin helps grow his business valuation
- Highlight "Competitive Advantage" -- ammunition against price-cutters
- Emphasize "Partner Enablement" -- training, presales support, marketing resources
- Use terms: "Recurring Revenue," "TCO," "Ecosystem," "Market Share"
- Focus on Partner Success Stories ("How Partner X grew revenue 200% in 2 years")
- Position Digiwin as "Profit Multiplier" -- pre-configured templates reduce deployment time by 30%

**What Repels (Don'ts):**
- Don't talk down to him as a "technician" -- address as a peer CEO
- Don't focus on "Ease of Use" -- focus on "Speed of Deployment" (= margin)
- Don't be vague about the Partner Model -- be clear: "We do not compete with you"
- Don't focus on features/technical specs -- he assumes the software works
- Red flag: any hint of channel conflict or direct sales competing with partners
- Red flag: expensive certifications or minimum commitments before revenue

**His Fears (Address on the Page):**
- "Liability Trap": software limitations exposing him to financial liability (line-down situations)
- Market Relevance: current offering becoming "Legacy Solution" -- needs AI/IoT narrative
- Vendor Lock-in: rigid, arrogant, unresponsive principals
- Disintermediation: principal using him for market entry then going direct

### Recommended Page Structure (from Website Brief)

1. **Home Hook:** "Transform from a Seller of Man-Hours to a Partner in Smart Manufacturing"
2. **Why Digiwin Page:** Thai Localization + IoT/MES Integration; closes the "Automation Gap"
3. **Product Ecosystem Page:** Show OT+IT stack visually with subpages:
   - T100 (Enterprise Backbone) -- "Tier-1 Killer" for complex multi-site groups
   - eMES (Shop Floor Enforcer) -- captures production data directly from machines/IoT
   - WMS (Inventory Shield) -- advanced lot tracking, FIFO, bin management
   - BMP (Business Process Management) -- digitalize SOPs
   - Workflow AiGP (SME Engine) -- rapid-deployment ERP for Tier 2/3 market, deeply localized for Thai tax/compliance
4. **Solutions Page:** Deep dive into Automotive & Electronics workflows
5. **Contact:** CTA = "Discuss your Project Margins with our Country Manager" (business-focused, not sales-focused)

### Visual & Tone Guidelines

- **Imagery:** Executive boardrooms, signing ceremonies, strategic planning sessions, owner-to-owner factory walkthroughs
- **Tone:** Executive-to-Executive. Professional, commercially astute, growth-focused
- **Language:** "Market Opportunity," "Scalable Architecture," "Revenue Mix," "Competitive Moat"

## Key Facts for Partner Program Page

### Trust Signals & Proof Points

- **44+ years** in manufacturing ERP (Taiwan + China)
- **75%+ market share** in Taiwan manufacturing ERP
- **#1 Manufacturing ERP** in China and Taiwan
- **"World Factory" narrative:** 40 years ago, Made in Taiwan = world factory; Digiwin has been the ERP backbone throughout this entire manufacturing evolution
- **50,000+ clients** across Asia
- **100+ Thai implementations**

- **Partner Council** structures (partner voice in product roadmap)

### Channel Integrity Messaging (Critical)

The #1 fear of prospective partners is **disintermediation** (Digiwin going direct). The website MUST address:

- "We respect your client ownership"
- "Our deal registration system guarantees your margins"
- "We win when you grow"
- "100% committed to the partner model"
- "We do not compete with you"
- Qualified Sales Lead Booking system as proof of channel protection

### SAP ECC End-of-Life Opportunity (2027)

Major opportunity to highlight on partner page:
- SAP ECC version stops support in 2027
- Customizations in ECC cannot be ported to S4 HANA -- companies must redevelop everything
- Cost of full S4 HANA migration is prohibitive for branch offices in Asia
- Digiwin + connector model offers 30-50% cost reduction vs. full SAP implementation in branches
- This is a concrete, time-sensitive opportunity partners can sell

### European Expansion Opportunity

For the "International Channel" narrative:
- European manufacturers opening Asia branches need local ERP for compliance
- They need: local tax/legal/finance compliance, Thai language support, local customer service
- They want: data consolidation back to HQ, remote manufacturing monitoring
- Digiwin provides: the "Asia Delivery Arm" with local compliance layer
- The connector model bridges HQ ERP (SAP/Oracle) with local Digiwin ERP

### Key Differentiators for Partner Page

1. **Partner-First DNA:** "The only ERP Principal fully dedicated to the Asian Manufacturing Context with a Partner-First DNA"
2. **Pre-configured Industry Templates:** Reduce deployment time by 30%, directly increasing project gross margin
3. **AI-Enabled Delivery (Central Kitchen):** Partners can deliver complex projects with lower-skilled staff using AI tools and templates
4. **OT+IT Integration:** IoT, MES, WMS suite gives partners new revenue streams beyond basic ERP
5. **Thai Localization Solved:** Local tax, BOI, Revenue Department compliance already built in
6. **No Channel Conflict:** Deal registration, territory protection, no direct sales competing with partners
7. **Low Barrier to Entry:** Referral tier available immediately upon signing; grow into Silver/Gold over time

### Product Portfolio for Partners

| Product | Target | Partner Opportunity |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| T100 | Large enterprises, multi-site groups | High-value projects, complex deployments |
| Workflow AiGP | SME Tier 2/3 market | High-volume "cash cow," rapid deployment |
| eMES | Shop floor tracking, IoT integration | Add-on revenue to existing ERP clients |
| WMS | Warehouse/inventory management | Add-on revenue, solves audit fears |
| BMP | Business process management | Recurring consulting revenue |

### CTA Recommendations

- Partner page CTA: "Discuss Your Business Growth with Our Country Manager"
- Avoid: "Request Demo," "Book a Demo"
- Use: "Let's Talk," "Get in Touch," "Explore the Partnership"
- Focus on business outcomes, not product features
