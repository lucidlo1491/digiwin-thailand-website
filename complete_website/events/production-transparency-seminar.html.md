The Challenge 

## Your Shop Floor Data Is Always a Day Behind

Most Thai factories still rely on paper reports filled out at shift-end. Operators jot down production counts, note quality issues in handwriting, and pass clipboards to supervisors who key the numbers into spreadsheets the following morning. By the time management sees the data, it's already yesterday's news.

The real cost isn't just the delay — it's the decisions made without current information. Managers allocate resources based on numbers that no longer reflect reality. Quality issues that could have been caught in minutes go unnoticed for hours, turning a small defect into an entire batch of scrap. A machine running below capacity doesn't get attention until tomorrow's report lands on someone's desk.

The difference between catching a problem in real-time and discovering it a day later can be **10x in cost**. MES (Manufacturing Execution System) dashboards change this equation entirely — giving you live production visibility so you can act on what's happening now, not what happened yesterday.

Seminar Outcomes 

## What You'll Walk Away With

### Understand the cost of delayed production visibility

Quantify what late data actually costs your factory — in scrap, rework, missed deliveries, and overtime.

### See a live MES dashboard in action with real factory data

Not slides or mockups — a working MES dashboard populated with real production data from a Thai factory.

### Identify which production metrics matter most for your industry

OEE, yield rate, cycle time, first-pass quality — learn which KPIs to track first based on your manufacturing type.

### Build a business case for real-time shop floor digitization

Leave with a framework to present the ROI of MES to your management team — grounded in real numbers, not vendor promises.

Half-Day Agenda 

## A Structured Afternoon — Not a Sales Pitch

Every session is designed around what you'll take home — not what we want to sell.

13:00 – 13:15 

### Registration & Networking

Coffee, introductions, and a quick survey of your current production reporting process.

13:15 – 14:00 

### Why Paper Reports Cost You More Than You Think

The hidden costs of delayed production data — in scrap, rework, overtime, and missed delivery windows. Real examples from Thai factories.

14:00 – 14:45 

### Live Demo — MES Dashboard Walk-Through

A working MES dashboard with real factory data. See production status, quality alerts, and OEE tracking in real time — not slides.

14:45 – 15:00 

### Coffee Break

15:00 – 15:45 

### Choosing the Right KPIs for Your Factory

Not every metric matters equally. Learn how to select the production KPIs that drive real improvements for your specific manufacturing type.

15:45 – 16:30 

### Panel: Real Factory Experiences with MES

Hear directly from factory operators who made the transition from paper to digital. What worked, what surprised them, and what they'd do differently.

16:30 – 17:00 

### Q&A + Next Steps

Open discussion, individual questions about your factory's situation, and guidance on where to start.

Who This Is For 

## Is This Seminar Right for You?

Factory Owner / Plant Manager 
Any Size Manufacturing 

You're responsible for overall factory performance but rely on end-of-day reports to understand what happened on the floor. You want visibility without having to walk over and ask.

"I need to know what's happening on my floor without walking over and asking."

Production / Operations Manager 
50-500 Employees 

You manage daily production schedules and troubleshoot problems as they arise — but you can only fix what you can see. Paper forms give you yesterday's picture, not today's reality.

"I need data I can trust, not numbers from yesterday's paper forms."
