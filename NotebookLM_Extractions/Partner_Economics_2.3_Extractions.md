*Concrete revenue mechanics and financial scenarios for partners — the "Spreadsheet Reality"*

---

## Step 1: Revenue Model Mechanics

*Sources: Distributor Price Sheets, Master Distributor Agreements, Ecosystem Strategy*

### 1. License Revenue: "Front-Loaded Cash Flow"

Unlike many SaaS vendors that trickle revenue over years, DigiWin provides substantial upfront margin on the software license to fund the partner's cash flow.

---

#### The Split

| Partner Level | Product | Partner Pays | Partner Keeps |
|---------------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Silver** | T100 / eMES | ~50% of list price | **~50% margin** |
| **Gold** | T100 / eMES | ~38% of list price | **~62% margin** |
| **Silver** | Workflow iGP | ~38% of list price | **~62% margin** |
| **Gold** | Workflow iGP | ~30% of list price | **~70% margin** |

---

#### The Mechanic
> You purchase the license key from DigiWin at the discounted "Distributor Price" and invoice the client at the "Suggested Selling Price" (SSP). The difference is **immediate gross profit** recognized upon delivery of the license key.

**Cash Flow Benefit:** Unlike SaaS where you wait 12-24 months to recoup client acquisition cost, you are profitable on the license from Day 1.

---

### 2. Service Revenue: "100% Retention"

DigiWin acts as a product vendor, not a service competitor. The partner retains the high-margin delivery work.

---

#### The Split
> Partners keep **100%** of all Implementation, Customization, and Training fees.

---

#### The Mechanic
> You scope the project based on "Actual Man-Days."

| Product | Typical Implementation Fee |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **Workflow iGP** | 800,000 – 1,200,000 THB |
| **T100 / eMES** | Charged monthly based on actual hours |

---

#### Strategic Concession
> DigiWin explicitly "gives up" this high-margin service revenue to the partner in exchange for market scale, unlike competitors who often mandate using their own high-cost professional services.

**The Logic:** We want partners to grow fat on services so they stay loyal to our products.

---

### 3. Recurring Support (MA): "The Annuity Stream"

Partners build a long-term asset by acting as the primary support contact (Tier 1), rather than just handing the client off to a vendor helpdesk.

---

#### The Cost to Client
> The standard Annual Maintenance (MA) fee is **12%** of the software's Suggested Selling Price (SSP), charged annually starting Year 2.

---

#### The Split

| Party | Share | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Partner Retains** | **75% (9% of SSP)** | Tier 1 Support (user questions, basic troubleshooting) |
| **DigiWin Takes** | 25% (3% of SSP) | Tier 2 Support (bug fixes, core code patches, R&D) |

---

#### The Mechanic
> You bill the client the full 12%; you remit only the 3% portion to DigiWin.

**Asset Building:** As your install base grows, your "passive" MA income eventually covers your basic operating costs—rent, junior staff, admin.

---

### 4. Upsell & Cross-Sell: "The Growth Multiplier"

Revenue does not end at Go-Live. The ecosystem is designed for "Land and Expand."

---

#### Customization (PaaS)
> Partners can build their own industry-specific modules or reports on the **Digiwin.cloud PaaS** platform. Partners charge the client for development and can even charge a "Hosting Fee" for these custom apps, creating a secondary recurring revenue stream.

**IP Building:** Custom modules you build become licensable assets, not just billable hours.

---

#### Module Expansion
> Once the ERP core is stable, partners return to sell high-value add-ons like **eMES**, **WMS**, or **AIoT**. The same license margin structure (40-70%) applies to these add-ons, allowing partners to "mine" their existing client base for years.

**Lifecycle Revenue:** A single client can generate 3-4 additional license sales over 5 years.

---

#### Referral Incentives
> If a partner identifies a lead but cannot deliver it (e.g., wrong industry or too large), they can refer it to DigiWin or another partner for a **5% to 10%** referral fee on the closed license value.

**No Wasted Leads:** Every opportunity generates some revenue, even if you can't close it yourself.

---

## Step 2: Realistic Year 1-2-3 Scenarios

*Sources: Distributor Price Sheets (T100, eMES, Workflow iGP), Master Distributor Agreements, Ecosystem Engine*

*Assumptions: Silver partner starting with SME product (Workflow iGP), graduating to Gold and larger projects (T100/eMES). Conservative estimates.*

---

### Year 1: The "Investment & Ramp" Phase

**Objective:** Survival, Certification, and First References.
**Status:** *Silver Partner (Co-Delivery Mode)*

---

#### The Reality
> Do not expect profit in Q1-Q2. Your focus is training your core team and closing the first "Pilot" deals with Digiwin's heavy assistance. You are learning the product, not just selling it.

---

#### Activity Timeline

| Quarter | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| **Q1-Q2** | 2 Senior Consultants undergo certification (Sales & Delivery). No revenue yet. |
| **Q3-Q4** | Close **2 Workflow iGP projects** (SME Manufacturing). |

---

#### The Math (Conservative)

| Revenue Stream | Amount (THB) | Calculation |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **License Revenue** | ~380,000 | 2x Workflow iGP Base Licenses at ~50% margin |
| **Service Revenue** | ~1,600,000 | 100% of implementation (~800k per project) |
| **Recurring (MA)** | 0 | First year warranty period |
| **Total Year 1** | **~1,980,000** | |

*Note: Efficiency will be low; actual margin is thin due to learning curve.*

---

#### The Outcome
> You break even or take a small loss on labor, but you now have **2 reference sites** and a certified team. You have survived the "Valley of Death."

---

### Year 2: The "Cash Flow" Phase

**Objective:** Efficiency and Margin Expansion.
**Status:** *Transition to Gold Partner (Independent Delivery)*

---

#### The Reality
> Your team can now deploy Workflow iGP without Digiwin's hand-holding. You stop bleeding hours on learning. You introduce the "Reverse Cut" strategy (selling eMES) to existing or new clients.

---

#### Activity

| Type | Volume |
|------|--------|
| **New Sales** | 3 Workflow iGP projects + 1 eMES (Standalone) project |
| **Recurring** | Year 1 clients start paying MA (Maintenance) |

---

#### The Math (Conservative)

| Revenue Stream | Amount (THB) | Calculation |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **License Revenue** | ~1,100,000 | Margins improve to ~60% as Gold Partner |
| **Service Revenue** | ~3,500,000 | 3x iGP + 1x eMES implementation |
| **Recurring (MA)** | ~100,000 | 9% of SSP from Year 1 clients |
| **Total Year 2** | **~4,700,000** | |

*Note: Higher net margin as deployment speed increases by ~30%.*

---

#### The Outcome
> You are now a **profitable practice**. Service revenue funds operations; license revenue is pure profit. The MA check covers your office rent.

---

### Year 3: The "Asset Building" Phase

**Objective:** Recurring Revenue & Tier-1 Upmarket Moves.
**Status:** *Gold Partner (Specialized)*

---

#### The Reality
> You are no longer just "hunting." The "farming" engine kicks in. Your install base generates enough passive MA to cover a junior consultant's salary. You attempt your first Tier-1 displacement (T100) or high-value AIoT upsell.

---

#### Activity

| Type | Volume |
|------|--------|
| **New Sales** | 4 Workflow iGP + 1 T100 (Enterprise) or 2 eMES add-ons |
| **Upsell** | Selling modules (WMS, Quality) to Year 1 & 2 clients |

---

#### The Math (Conservative)

| Revenue Stream | Amount (THB) | Calculation |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **License Revenue** | ~2,000,000+ | T100 license fees ~1M+ per deal |
| **Service Revenue** | ~5,000,000+ | T100 projects command higher daily rates |
| **Recurring (MA)** | ~350,000+ | Cumulative base from 3 years |
| **Total Year 3** | **~7,350,000+** | |

---

#### The Outcome
> Your business valuation shifts. You aren't just selling man-days; you have a **recurring revenue stream** and a "sticky" client base locked in with high-retention manufacturing systems. You have built an asset, not just a job.

---

### Summary: 3-Year Trajectory

| Metric | Year 1 (Learning) | Year 2 (Scaling) | Year 3 (Asset) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Partner Level** | Silver (Co-Delivery) | Gold (Independent) | Gold (Specialized) |
| **License Margin** | ~40-50% | ~50-60% | ~60%+ |
| **Service Retention** | 100% (Low Efficiency) | 100% (Med Efficiency) | 100% (High Efficiency) |
| **Recurring (MA)** | 0 (Warranty) | Starts (Small) | **Compounding Growth** |
| **Total Revenue** | ~2M THB | ~4.7M THB | ~7.4M+ THB |
| **Your State** | *Surviving* | *Profitable* | *Building Asset Value* |

---

## Step 3: Risk Mitigation (Protection Structure)

*Sources: Distributor Master Agreement, Ecosystem Engine, Executive Strategy*

### 1. Territory & Conflict Protection: "Your Leads Are Locked"

---

#### The 6-Month Ironclad Lock
> We utilize a formal **"Qualified Sales Lead Booking"** system. Once you register a validated opportunity (Thai Local Enterprise), it is legally locked to you for **6 months** (renewable for another 3). During this period, neither Digiwin's direct team nor other distributors can approach the client.

**Legal Basis:** Master Distributor Agreement, Clause 5.

---

#### Structural Market Segmentation
> We do not rely on a "gentleman's agreement." Our direct sales team is structurally restricted to serving **Chinese and Taiwanese inbound** accounts. The **Thai Local Market** is exclusively designated for partners.

**Why this matters:** Prevents the "predatory vendor" behavior common with other principals.

---

#### The "Non-Compete" Clause
> The Master Agreement explicitly states: *"Party A [Digiwin] is not allowed to operate the sales lead that has been booked by Party B during the valid period."*

**Legal Recourse:** This gives you contractual protection, not just promises.

---

### 2. Co-Implementation Support: "You Are Never Alone on Go-Live"

---

#### Tiered Support Responsibility

| Tier | Responsibility | Owner |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Tier 1** | User questions, process consulting, basic configs | **Partner** |
| **Tier 2** | Core code bugs, API failures, R&D | **DigiWin** |

**The Benefit:** You maintain the client relationship face-to-face, but you never have to debug core software on your own.

---

#### The "Entrusted Service" Safety Net
> If you sell a project but lack the capacity to deliver it (e.g., your team is fully booked), you can sign an **"Entrusted Service Agreement"** where Digiwin's HQ team delivers the project on your behalf under your brand.

**Capacity Protection:** Capture revenue without being bottlenecked by headcount.

---

#### On-Site Pilot Assistance
> For your first projects (Silver Level), we provide on-site guidance for critical phases like **Basic Data Setting** and **Go-Live Simulation**, ensuring your team learns by doing alongside our experts rather than struggling in isolation.

**Learning Model:** "Earn while you learn" on live projects.

---

### 3. Training & Certification: "Competency Transfer, Not Just Manuals"

---

#### Mandatory "Muscle Memory" Training
> We don't just hand you a PDF. Your staff must undergo specific certification tracks for **Sales, Pre-sales, and Delivery**. This is a contractual requirement to ensure your team is capable of defending the solution in front of clients within 3-5 months of signing.

**Quality Assurance:** Protects you from delivering a failed project.

---

#### Role-Based Certification

| Certification | Unlocks |
|---------------|---------|
| **T100 Certified** | Enterprise project delivery |
| **eMES Certified** | Factory floor implementation |
| **Gold Partner Status** | Higher margins (up to ~60%) + greater autonomy |

---

#### Sales "Weaponization"
> We provide the "Arsenal"—industry-specific whitepapers, ROI calculators, and localized demo scripts—so your sales team goes into meetings acting like **manufacturing consultants**, not just software sellers.

**Competitive Advantage:** You don't have to create marketing materials from scratch.

---

### 4. Demand Generation: "We Feed the Army"

---

#### 100% Lead Distribution from Roadshows
> We invest in high-cost **Brand Roadshows** and digital marketing to generate leads. Unlike vendors who keep the best leads for themselves, our policy is to distribute **100% of local SME leads** generated from these events to qualified partners who attend.

**Lead Quality:** Pre-qualified leads, not cold lists.

---

#### The "Deal Registration" Privilege
> Gold Partners receive **priority allocation** of high-quality inbound leads (allocation based on performance). We act as the marketing engine; you act as the closing and delivery engine.

**Division of Labor:** We generate demand; you capture and service it.
