## Step 1: Heritage & Credibility Evidence

*Sources: Corporate Profiles (2025), Market Strategy Reports, Company History Slides*

### 1. Key Milestones: "Stability Through Decades of Change"

---

#### The 43-Year Foundation
> Founded in **1982** (as Data Systems Consulting). We have survived every economic cycle—from the Asian Financial Crisis to Covid-19—without abandoning our manufacturing focus. You are partnering with a company that has history, not a startup burning venture capital.

**Why it matters:** Proves staying power through multiple market crashes.

---

#### Public Financial Transparency
> We are a publicly listed company on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (**Stock Code: 300378**), listed since **2014**. Our financials are public, audited, and transparent, mitigating the risk of vendor bankruptcy that plagues smaller software houses.

**Why it matters:** Financial stability is verifiable, not just claimed.

---

#### Strategic Validation
> In **July 2020**, **Foxconn Industrial Internet (FII)** became a strategic investor. This is not just funding; it is validation from the world's largest electronics manufacturer that our software is capable of handling the most demanding production environments on earth.

**Why it matters:** Endorsement from the ultimate authority in high-volume manufacturing.

---

### 2. Manufacturing Focus: "We Didn't Just Adapt to Factory Work; We Were Born In It"

---

#### R&D Density
> Unlike marketing-led software companies, **1,500+** of our 5,500 employees are R&D engineers. We invest heavily in the specific code that runs factories—scheduling algorithms, IoT protocols, and costing logic—not just user interfaces.

**Why it matters:** Deep technical capability, not just sales and marketing.

---

#### Market Dominance in "Hard" Sectors
> We serve **77%** of publicly listed manufacturers in Taiwan. In a market known for high-tech precision (semiconductors, electronics), the majority trust Digiwin. This proves our system handles complexity, not just basic assembly.

**Why it matters:** If Taiwan's precision manufacturers trust us, Thai factories can too.

---

#### Scale of Experience
> We support over **50,000 manufacturing clients** across Asia. Our templates aren't theories; they are built on the aggregated best practices of thousands of actual factories.

**Why it matters:** Battle-tested, not theoretical.

---

### 3. Geographic Expansion: "We Are Local, Not Remote"

---

#### The ASEAN Commitment
> We didn't just land in Thailand yesterday. We established **Digiwin Vietnam in 2008**, **Malaysia in 2013**, and **Thailand in 2019** (after researching the market since 2017). We recently added **Indonesia (2024)**. This is a methodical, long-term regional strategy, not a "test the waters" sales office.

**Timeline:**
| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2008 | Vietnam established |
| 2013 | Malaysia established |
| 2017 | Thailand market research begins |
| 2019 | Thailand established |
| 2024 | Indonesia established |

---

#### Physical Presence
> We operate **35 branches** in Mainland China and **6 branches** in Taiwan, alongside our Southeast Asia hubs. In Thailand, we are physically located at **Bangna Complex Office Tower**, right at the gateway to the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) manufacturing heartland, not in a downtown coworking space.

**Why it matters:** We're where the factories are, not where the startups are.

---

### 4. Leadership & Ownership Signals: "Backed by Giants"

---

#### Foxconn DNA
> Our strategic alignment with Foxconn Industrial Internet signals to factory owners that we are moving toward **AIoT (AI + IoT)** and "Lights Out" manufacturing. We are building the software infrastructure for the next generation of smart factories, backed by the company that defines that category.

---

#### Certified Maturity
> We hold **CMMI Level 4** certification for software development maturity. This is a rare credential for ERP vendors and assures buyers that our software development process is rigorous, predictable, and low-risk.

**Why it matters:** Process discipline, not just code.

---

## Step 2: Regional Commitment (Thailand Proof)

*Sources: Corporate Profiles (2025), Market Strategy Reports, Executive Transcripts*

### 1. Years in Thailand: "Methodical, Not Accidental"

---

#### Timeline
> We didn't just land recently. We entered **Southeast Asia in 2008 (Vietnam)**, expanded to **Malaysia in 2013**, and established **Digiwin Thailand in 2019** after two years of market research. We recently added **Indonesia (2024)**. This is a deliberate, decades-long ASEAN strategy, not a short-term experiment.

---

#### Physical Roots
> We are headquartered at **Bangna Complex Office Tower** (22nd Floor), strategically located at the gateway to the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) industrial heartland, positioning us physically close to our manufacturing clients rather than in a downtown sales office.

**Address Signal:** Bangna = EEC gateway = manufacturing focus

---

### 2. Thai Team Size & Composition: "Real Support, No Translation Needed"

---

#### Local Infrastructure
> We have built a **"Local Thai Call Center"** and a delivery team of **Thai Consultants** who are bilingual (Thai/Chinese). This ensures your staff can get support in their native language without needing an interpreter to talk to HQ.

---

#### Scale
> Our operation is supported by a regional network of **5,500+ employees** across Asia, including **1,500+ R&D engineers**. In Thailand, we have established a full-function team covering Sales, Pre-sales, and Delivery, moving beyond just a "representative office" structure.

**Team Structure:**
- Thai Call Center (native language support)
- Thai Consultants (bilingual Thai/Chinese)
- Full Sales, Pre-sales, and Delivery functions

---

### 3. Local Implementations: "Proven in Your Neighborhood"

---

#### Critical Mass
> We have already secured **100+ customers and partners** in Thailand. You are not the "guinea pig."

---

#### Named References
> We serve recognizable local manufacturers across diverse sectors:
- **GoldenSea Sanki**
- **Top Mould**
- **Accauto**
- **Unique New Energy**
- **Intensive Mould**

These are active production environments running on our systems today.

---

#### Localization
> We have successfully localized for **Thai Revenue Department** requirements, including specific features for **Withholding Tax** and **e-Tax** integration, proving our software is legally compliant and ready for Thai audits.

**Compliance Features:**
- Thai Revenue Department certified
- Withholding Tax logic
- e-Tax integration
- BOI reporting support

---

### 4. Regional Investment Signals: "Building an Engine, Not Just a Pipeline"

---

#### The Ecosystem Strategy
> We are replicating a proven "Ecosystem Engine" model that prioritizes **"Localization First"** (solving tax/compliance hurdles before selling) and **"Partner Empowerment"** (giving partners high-margin service revenue). This structural choice binds our success to the long-term success of local Thai partners.

---

#### Strategic Backing
> Our expansion is backed by **Foxconn Industrial Internet (FII)**, signaling a long-term capital commitment to building the digital infrastructure for Asian manufacturing, specifically targeting the "China+1" supply chain shift to ASEAN.

**Why it matters:** We're not here to test the market; we're here to build the infrastructure.

---

## Step 3: Foxconn Investment Narrative

*Sources: Corporate Profiles (2025), Company History Slides*

### 1. What the Investment Actually Means

**Concept:** "Strategic Validation, Not Just Funding."

---

#### The Fact
> In **July 2020**, Foxconn Industrial Internet (FII, Stock Code: 601138) became a key strategic shareholder in Digiwin.

---

#### The Signal
> This was not a venture capital bet. It was a strategic move by the world's largest electronics manufacturer to select a software partner capable of digitizing the Asian supply chain. It signals that Digiwin's "manufacturing-first" code base is robust enough to support the industrial internet strategy of a global giant.

---

### 2. What Capabilities It Brings

**Concept:** "Bridging the IT-OT Gap."

---

#### The Tech
> The investment specifically accelerates the development of **AIoT (Artificial Intelligence + Internet of Things)** platforms. It moves Digiwin beyond "Office Software" (IT) into "Machine Software" (OT).

---

#### The Integration
> It validates Digiwin's ability to execute **"IT + OT Convergence"**—connecting top-floor financial planning (ERP) with shop-floor machine data (MES). FII's backing ensures Digiwin has the R&D resources to build the "Industrial Internet" infrastructure required for the next decade of smart manufacturing.

---

### 3. How It Benefits Customers & Partners

---

#### For Customers
> It answers the question, *"Will your software handle Industry 4.0?"* The FII partnership ensures that the system you buy today is being evolved to handle "Lights Out" manufacturing, predictive maintenance, and machine-to-machine communication tomorrow. You are buying into the R&D roadmap of the world's most advanced manufacturing ecosystem.

---

#### For Partners
> It provides a "Competitive Moat." While local competitors are stuck selling basic accounting software, Digiwin partners can pitch a solution backed by Foxconn's manufacturing DNA. It differentiates you from generic software vendors by aligning you with the standard-setter of global production.

---

### 4. How to State It (No Hype)

**Tone:** Calm Authority.

| Do Say | Don't Say |
|--------|-----------|
| "Backed by Foxconn Industrial Internet to drive the convergence of IT and OT in Asian manufacturing." | "We are Foxconn" (implies we're just their internal tool) |
| "In 2020, we secured strategic investment from Foxconn Industrial Internet (FII), validating our position as the bridge between enterprise finance and the factory floor." | "Powered by Foxconn" (too vague and marketing-heavy) |

---

## Step 4: Market Leadership (Without Arrogance)

*Sources: Corporate Profile (2025), Market Strategy Reports, Company History Slides*

### 1. Specific Rankings & Evidence (The Data)

**Rule:** Don't say "We are the market leader." Say "The market data shows..."

---

#### Manufacturing ERP Leadership (China)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Market Share** | 14.8% in China's Manufacturing ERP market | YiOu Intelligence (iyiou.com), March 2022 |
| **Position** | Leads the manufacturing ERP sector in Mainland China | Third-party research |

---

#### High-Tech Dominance (Taiwan)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Listed Company Coverage** | 77% of all publicly listed companies in Taiwan | CommonWealth Magazine |
| **Manufacturing Sector** | 84% of the listed manufacturing sector | Top 2000 Manufacturing Enterprises Survey (2023) |

---

#### Smart Manufacturing (MES/Industry 4.0)

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Position** | Ranked No. 1 in Smart Manufacturing Industry (China) | 2018 data point |
| **Validation** | Foxconn Industrial Internet (FII) strategic investment | 2020 |

---

### 2. Context That Makes It Meaningful (The "So What?")

**Rule:** Don't just list the award. Explain why it reduces risk for the buyer.

---

#### Why the "Taiwan 84%" stat matters to a Thai factory
> "Taiwanese manufacturers are the global benchmark for precision electronics and supply chain efficiency (e.g., Apple supply chain). If 84% of them trust Digiwin, it proves our software handles the extreme complexity of high-tech manufacturing—traceability, yield management, and miniaturization—that generic ERPs cannot."

---

#### Why the "14.8% China Share" matters to a Distributor
> "China is the 'World's Factory.' Leading this market means we have stress-tested our system against the highest production volumes and most aggressive delivery timelines on earth. You aren't selling experimental software; you are selling the engine of Asian production."

---

#### Why the "Foxconn" connection matters
> "It's not just financial backing. It represents a technology transfer. We are building the 'Industrial Internet' standards used by Foxconn into our software, making them available to mid-sized manufacturers."

---

### 3. How to State It (Factual, Not Boastful)

**Rule:** Use passive voice for accolades ("We were recognized") and active voice for client outcomes ("Clients achieved").

---

#### Instead of: "We are the best ERP for electronics."
> **Say:** "In Taiwan's highly competitive electronics sector, **84% of listed manufacturers** rely on Digiwin to manage their operations."

---

#### Instead of: "We are the Industry 4.0 leaders."
> **Say:** "Recognized by IDC and CommonWealth Magazine for our density in the manufacturing sector, and strategically backed by Foxconn Industrial Internet to drive IT-OT convergence."

---

#### Instead of: "We have the most experience."
> **Say:** "With **43 years** of focus and over **50,000 manufacturing clients**, our templates are built on the aggregated best practices of thousands of factories, not just software theory."
