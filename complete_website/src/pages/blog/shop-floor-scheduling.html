            Every production planner knows the feeling. You spend Monday morning building a precise weekly schedule — machine assignments, order sequences, material availability all perfectly coordinated. By Monday afternoon, a machine is down for unplanned maintenance. A rush order arrives from a key customer. A material delivery is delayed by two days. Your perfect plan is obsolete.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            This is not a sign of poor planning. It is a reflection of manufacturing reality. Production schedules are built on assumptions about machine uptime, material availability, and stable demand. Every one of those assumptions gets challenged every day. The question is not whether your plan will need adjustment — it is whether your system makes those adjustments visible or invisible to the people who depend on accurate scheduling information.

        <!-- Section: The Gap Between Planning and Floor -->
        <h2 class="fade-in">The Gap Between Planning and the Floor</h2>

        <p class="fade-in">
            In most factories, there is a wall between the planning department and the production floor. Planning creates schedules in the ERP. The floor supervisor receives a printout or a static schedule view. When reality forces changes — and it always does — the supervisor adjusts by instinct and experience.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            These changes happen in the supervisor's head or on a whiteboard. Planning does not know about them until the next day's production report. By then, the plan and reality have diverged. The planning system says Line 3 is running Order 4521. The floor supervisor moved that order to Line 2 this morning because Line 3 had a tooling issue. The system does not know. Downstream planning decisions — material staging, quality checks, shipping schedules — are based on obsolete information.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            This gap creates cascading problems. Warehouse teams prepare materials for the wrong production sequence. Quality inspectors wait at the wrong line. Maintenance schedules conflict with actual production. Customer service quotes delivery dates based on schedules that no longer reflect reality. Everyone is working hard, but they are working from different versions of the truth.
        </p>

        <div class="blog-pullquote fade-in">
            The best production plan is one that adapts to reality without losing visibility. Mini-scheduling keeps the floor flexible and planning informed.
        </div>

        <!-- Section: What Mini-Scheduling Does -->
        <h2 class="fade-in">What Mini-Scheduling Does</h2>

        <p class="fade-in">
            DigiWin's shop floor mini-scheduling bridges this gap. Floor supervisors can adjust production sequences, reassign machines, and reschedule orders directly in the system — in real-time. These changes are immediately visible to the planning department. The system recalculates downstream impacts (material requirements, delivery dates, capacity utilization) automatically.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            This is not a separate scheduling system. It is the same system planning uses, integrated through <a href="../products/mes.html">DigiWin's MES solution</a>, with permissions and interfaces designed for floor-level decision-making. The supervisor does not need to understand the full ERP. They see their lines, their machines, their orders. When they make an adjustment, it is recorded in the same database planning reads from. There is no reconciliation step, no phone call to inform planning, no manual log entry at end-of-shift.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            The planning department maintains strategic control. They set the master schedule — weekly or daily production plans based on demand forecasts, material availability, and capacity constraints. Mini-scheduling does not override this. It adjusts execution within the boundaries planning has defined. If the floor supervisor tries to move an order that would violate material availability or customer commitment dates, the system flags it. The supervisor can see <strong>why</strong> the adjustment is problematic and make an informed decision.
        </p>

        <!-- Section: How It Works -->
        <h2 class="fade-in">How It Works</h2>

        <p class="fade-in">
            The workflow is straightforward. The production planner sets the master schedule — which orders run on which lines, in which sequence, starting when. This schedule is visible to floor supervisors on their screens (desktop, tablet, or terminal). When adjustments are needed, the supervisor can:
        </p>

        <ul class="fade-in">
            <li><strong>Drag-and-drop resequence orders</strong> on a machine (move Order B ahead of Order A because the material for A is delayed)</li>
            <li><strong>Move an order to a different machine or line</strong> (shift Order C from Line 3 to Line 2 because Line 3 has a maintenance issue)</li>
            <li><strong>Split a production order across shifts</strong> (run 500 units on day shift, 300 on night shift to meet a rush request)</li>
            <li><strong>Flag delays that affect downstream orders</strong> (mark Order D as delayed so dependent orders in assembly are rescheduled automatically)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="fade-in">
            Every change is logged and immediately visible to planning. No phone calls, no whiteboards, no next-day surprises. The planning team can see, in real-time, what adjustments the floor has made and why. If planning needs to intervene — for example, if a floor adjustment creates a delivery risk — they can communicate directly with the supervisor through the system or escalate as needed.
        </p>

        <!-- Section: Why This Matters for Thai Manufacturers -->
        <h2 class="fade-in">Why This Matters for Thai Manufacturers</h2>

        <p class="fade-in">
            In Thailand's manufacturing landscape, floor supervisors are often the most experienced people in the factory. They know which machines run better on certain products, which operators are strongest on which lines, and when to push for overtime versus split production across shifts. This knowledge is not written down. It lives in their heads, built over years of experience.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            Mini-scheduling does not replace their judgment. It digitizes it. When a supervisor makes a decision — "I am moving this order to Line 2 because the tooling setup is already there from the previous run" — that decision becomes part of the system's record. Planning can see not just <strong>what</strong> changed, but <strong>why</strong>. Over time, these patterns become visible. Planning can learn from the floor's adjustments and incorporate that intelligence into future master schedules.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            This is particularly valuable in Thailand's industrial context, where many factories operate with lean planning teams. The planning department might be two or three people responsible for scheduling hundreds of production orders across dozens of machines. They cannot micromanage every adjustment. Mini-scheduling gives them something better: <strong>visibility</strong>. They can see what the floor is doing, trust the supervisors' expertise, and intervene only when strategic issues arise.
        </p>

        <div class="blog-highlight fade-in">
            <p><strong>Common mini-scheduling adjustments in Thai factories:</strong> Resequencing orders to minimize tooling changeovers when material delays force schedule changes; shifting production to night shift when rush orders arrive mid-day; moving orders between parallel lines when one machine develops quality issues; splitting large orders across shifts to balance overtime costs with delivery commitments.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section: Closing -->
        <h2 class="fade-in">Planning as Conversation, Not Broadcast</h2>

        <p class="fade-in">
            Production planning should not be a one-way broadcast. It should be a conversation between planning and the floor. Planning sets the strategy — what needs to be produced, by when, with what resources. The floor executes the tactics — how to adapt that strategy to today's reality. When both sides can see what the other is doing, you get something rare in manufacturing: <strong>alignment</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            Mini-scheduling makes that conversation happen in real-time, with full visibility for everyone who needs it. Planning does not lose control. The floor does not lose flexibility. And the entire factory operates from the same version of the truth — a schedule that reflects not just what was planned, but what is actually happening.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            If your current system forces supervisors to make adjustments on whiteboards or in their heads, you have a visibility gap. That gap creates inefficiency, delays, and missed commitments. It also wastes the most valuable resource in your factory: the experience and judgment of the people who know the production floor best. Mini-scheduling closes that gap. It gives supervisors the tools to adjust, and planning the visibility to stay informed. That is how modern manufacturing should work.
        </p>
