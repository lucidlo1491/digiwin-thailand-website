## Template & CSS Notes

- Uses shared blog template from `styles.css` (blog-hero, blog-body, blog-related, blog-cta classes)
- Only inline CSS: `.blog-category-badge { background: #D97706; }` (1 line)
- This is the **target pattern** for blog articles — zero custom CSS beyond badge color

### Opening / Hook

After visiting hundreds of factories across Thailand, a pattern emerges. The products are different — auto parts, electronics, plastics, food — but the frustrations are the same. Five problems show up in almost every conversation with factory owners. These pain points don't discriminate by industry, company size, or product complexity. They are universal symptoms of a deeper structural issue: the gap between how manufacturing systems work and how manufacturing actually happens.

This article comes from DigiWin's presale methodology — the framework our team uses in every factory visit to understand where operations are breaking down. These five questions surface the problems that Thai manufacturers live with every day, often without realizing they're solvable.

### Section 1: Pain Point 1 — Cost Opacity

**Diagnostic question:** "Do you know your real production cost per batch?"

Key arguments:
- Most factory owners know average cost, few know batch-to-batch cost
- Material prices fluctuate, yield rates vary, rework happens — averages hide losses
- One batch might profit 20%, the next loses 5%, monthly report shows comfortable 8% margin that masks volatility
- Problem compounds when quoting new contracts based on last quarter's average
- Cost opacity is a strategic blind spot — can't optimize what you can't see, can't identify which products/customers/production runs are actually profitable

### Section 2: Pain Point 2 — Production Transparency

**Diagnostic question:** "What's happening on your shop floor right now?"

Key arguments:
- Owner's office is 50 meters from production floor, but information gap is enormous
- Production reports arrive at end of shift/day — problems already compounded
- Machine downtime unnoticed for 45 minutes, quality issues affect 200 units before flagged
- Creates reactive management style — constant firefighting
- Customer status inquiry takes 10 minutes of phone chains; competitor with visibility answers in 10 seconds

### Section 3: Pain Point 3 — Paper-Based Reporting Gaps

**Diagnostic question:** "How many hours do you spend reconciling production reports?"

Key arguments:
- Paper-based production reporting is slow, inaccurate, and manipulable
- Production quantities rounded up, scrap rates rounded down, material consumption estimated
- Data entry chain: operator memory → paper form → supervisor → data entry → system (days of delay)
- Accounting reconciliation reveals gaps — inventory doesn't match, hours don't align
- Factory spends days investigating discrepancies

**Pull quote:** "Paper-based production reporting isn't just slow — it creates data gaps that get filled with approximations, estimates, and memory. By the time the numbers reach management, they've already diverged from reality."

### Section 4: Pain Point 4 — Planning vs. Reality Disconnect

**Diagnostic question:** "Does your production plan survive first contact with the shop floor?"

Key arguments:
- Plans made Monday morning, obsolete by Monday afternoon (machine down, material late, rush order)
- Two parallel realities: the plan in the system vs. reality on the shop floor
- Floor supervisor adjusts by instinct — changes planning doesn't know about until next day
- Tomorrow's schedule built on foundation that no longer reflects reality
- Problem compounds with multiple simultaneous disruptions

### Section 5: Pain Point 5 — Delivery Accuracy

**Diagnostic question:** "When your customer calls about their order, can you answer in 10 seconds?"

Key arguments:
- Ultimate test of operational visibility
- Status inquiry requires phone chain: salesperson → planning → production floor → whiteboard check
- Delivery accuracy is about trust — missed promises damage relationships
- Delivery accuracy depends on all other four pain points being solved
- "Delivery accuracy is the symptom. The other four pain points are the disease."

**Data card:** "5 Pain Points, 1 Root Cause — When your ERP, shop floor, and warehouse speak different languages, every decision is based on delayed, approximated data."

---

### Closing: The Common Thread

- Five symptoms of the same underlying issue: **disconnected systems**
- ERP, MES, warehouse systems don't talk to each other in real-time
- Solution is connecting existing systems, not working harder
- When production data flows machine → ERP → dashboard in real-time, all five pain points begin to dissolve
- Cost opacity disappears with production-order-level material/labor capture
- Production transparency emerges with real-time shop floor data
- Paper gaps close with barcode/touchscreen input
- Planning-reality disconnect shrinks with live production status
- Delivery accuracy improves because you're looking at actual data, not guessing

**Closing pull quote:** "Every factory has these five problems. The question isn't whether they exist — it's how much they're costing you in margins, delivery penalties, and lost customers."

Final paragraph: Manufacturers that solve these don't hire more people or work longer hours — they close the gap between systems and shop floor reality.

## Flags & Notes

- **CTA link goes to demo.html** — This is the standard "Let's Talk" pattern, consistent with business constraint (no demos). The page name `demo.html` is a misnomer but is consistently used across the site as the contact/consultation page.
- **No images used** — Article is text-only, no stock photos or illustrations. This is consistent with the content-first blog pattern.
- **Jargon is well-handled** — OEE, BOM, MES are used naturally in context where meaning is clear. However, OEE and BOM are not spelled out on first use (violated Thai audience context guideline). MES is explained parenthetically.
- **"Hundreds of factories"** claim is imprecise — cross-checked data says "100+ Thai implementations." The presale claim of "hundreds" may include visits across SEA, not just implementations.
- **Strong thematic structure** — Each pain point follows identical pattern (diagnostic question → problem description → consequences), creating scannable, consistent reading experience.
- **Article title says "Factory Owner"** but related articles card text says "Thai Manufacturer" — minor inconsistency in how the article is referenced from other pages.
