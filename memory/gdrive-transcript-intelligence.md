## Strategic Intelligence Summary

### 1. Three-Track Market Entry (VP Directive)

| Track | Approach | Target |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Track 1 | Financial/Inventory ERP | Direct sales to Thai manufacturers |
| Track 2 | "Reverse Cut" via MES/IoT | Enter through shop floor, gradually replace Odoo/SAP B1 |
| Track 3 | Fill the SAP Gap | Companies where SAP is too expensive but need enterprise capability |

**Primary strategy = Track 2 "Reverse Cut"**: Lead with MES/production management, then pull through to ERP. Exploits Odoo/SAP B1 implementers' weakness in manufacturing.

### 2. 2026 Revenue Targets

| Market | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Thailand Direct | NT$130M (~USD 4.1M) | First year with self-generated revenue |
| Vietnam Direct | NT$70M (~USD 2.2M) | |
| New Countries | NT$15M (~USD 470K) | |
| **Total Direct** | **~NT$215M (~USD 6.7M)** | |
| Partner share of SEA | ~20% → growing | Must eventually exceed direct |
| Revenue mix | 55% own / 45% partner | |

### 3. Q2 2026 Hard Deadline

- Signed distributor must be productive (bringing customers)
- End-customer deals must be in pipeline
- 2-3 market events must have run (one/month Apr-Jun)
- 10 end-customer opportunities minimum
- Thai website must be live (Q1 infrastructure)

### 4. BOI Compliance = Killer Differentiator

**The Jin Hai Case (proven):**
- DigiWin T100 customer, 10+ years in Thailand
- Before: 10M+ THB/year supplementary taxes, BOI threatened revocation
- After DigiWin implementation: 150K THB (2024) → zero (2025)
- Difference: production-order-based material reconciliation vs. theoretical BOM

**Competitive moat:** No competitor (Kingdee, Yonyou, SAP) has production-order-level BOI reconciliation. All require accountants to manually prepare separate BOI filings outside the system.

**Standalone BOI module planned:** Web-based, works with ANY ERP, covers BOI + Free Trade Zone reporting.

### 5. Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Thailand Presence | Weakness |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Kingdee (金蝶)** | ~20 people | BOI = theoretical BOM only, no production-level reconciliation |
| **Yonyou (用友)** | ~20 people | Same BOI weakness, failed in Vietnam first |
| **SAP** | Established but expensive | No co-products, no dual units, weak Thai localization, ECC end-of-life 2027 |
| **Odoo** | SEO-dominant, low distributor margins | No manufacturing depth (BOM/WO just released Nov 2025, implementers can't deploy) |

**Odoo/SAP B1 distributor economics:** Real license margins only 2-5% because manufacturer's SEO captures leads first.

### 6. DigiWin's Technical Competitive Weapons

| Feature | What It Does | Who Can't Match |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Co-product (联副产品)** | One work order → multiple outputs with proper cost allocation | SAP, Kingdee, Yonyou |
| **LRP (Lot Requirements Planning)** | Per-order material calc in <1 min vs. MRP's hours | Traditional MRP systems |
| **AMRP** | Capacity planning built into ERP (no separate APS) | Oracle/SAP (require separate APS purchase) |
| **Dual units** | Show both kg AND pieces simultaneously | SAP B1 (single unit only) |
| **Shop floor mini-scheduling** | Floor supervisors adjust schedule in real-time, visible to planning | All competitors |
| **BOI reconciliation** | Production-order-based material consumption vs. theoretical BOM | Kingdee, Yonyou, SAP |
| **Product traceability** | Reverse + forward tracing to machine/process level | SAP (less granular) |

### 7. Company Transformation: Software → AI Infrastructure

**2026 mandate from CEO Pan Taihe:**
- Rebuilding all 68 ERP SOPs with AI Agents (80% by end of 2026)
- Two agent types: Action Agents (routine workflows) + Plan Agents (expert decisions)
- Taiwan proof: 600 customers upgraded to AI-GP in 2025, avg NT$900K/deal
- 168 AI Agents developed Apr-Dec 2025 (from zero)
- **Zhuge Platform** = multi-agent orchestration (like N8N but with dynamic AI judgment)

**New revenue streams:**
- AI-GP base upgrades
- Cybersecurity emergency response (NT$60M in Taiwan, targeting NT$120M)
- IoT + AI convergence (reverse-control via Tianshu Controller)
- AI Agent marketplace (CPA model)

### 8. Presale Methodology (Eddie's Framework)

**Core principles:**
1. **NEVER open the ERP system in a demo** — "zero score behavior"
2. **Know the customer's industry** before visiting — end product, processes, pain points
3. **Story-driven discovery** — don't interrogate, tell industry stories that resonate
4. **Pain-first, layered questioning** — go deeper at each level until the customer calculates ROI themselves
5. **Speak manufacturing language** — not system language
6. **Top-down sales** — always reach the boss first, not IT
7. **Selection > effort** — qualify ruthlessly before investing resources

**Universal pain points (all manufacturing):**
1. Cost opacity (batch-to-batch fluctuations)
2. Production transparency (can't see shop floor in real-time)
3. Paper-based fraud (production reports are late, inaccurate, manipulable)
4. Planning vs. reality disconnect
5. Delivery accuracy (can't answer customer inquiries in real-time)

### 9. Partner Channel Intelligence

**Ambition (Chinese consulting):**
- ~70 staff, offices in Hangzhou/Ningbo/Thailand/Indonesia
- 4 service lines: Legal, Finance/Tax, Compliance (incl. BOI), Commercial
- Encounters customers at pre-investment stage → steers to DigiWin for ERP
- ~30+ manufacturing clients, many with BOI certificates
- BOI module co-development planned

**Alfa Sistemi (Italian ERP consultancy):**
- Carli = 25yr ERP veteran (SAP, Oracle, Microsoft)
- "Connector" model: European HQ keeps SAP/Oracle, Thai branch uses DigiWin, Alfa builds middleware
- Lead source: Thai-Italian Chamber of Commerce (TICC)
- SAP ECC end-of-life 2027 = forced migration window
- Target: Italian manufacturers with Thai branches (automotive parts, home appliance)

**Four distributor types (VP framework):**
1. Customer-base holders (have existing relationships)
2. Sales-capable (understand manufacturing software)
3. Delivery-capable (can implement ERP)
4. Network expanders (generate referrals)

**Five distributor source categories:**
1. Odoo/SAP B1 implementers
2. Accounting firms (visibility into growing/IPO-track factories)
3. Management consultants (ISO, business efficiency)
4. Industrial equipment SIs (machine tools, injection molding)
5. Academic/university connections

### 10. Thailand Market Data Points

- **50,000+** companies scraped, filtered to **8,000** genuine targets
- Only **113** properly qualified so far — **7,000 remain uncovered**
- **~900** companies now have verified contact details
- **~50 factory clients** onboarded in 2025 (~10-12 T100, rest Workflow)
- **Target customers = pure Thai companies** (not Chinese-invested)
- Almost 100% of new manufacturing entrants have BOI; ~80% have bonded material import
- Kingdee/Yonyou now have ~20-person offices (competitive threat escalating)
- Thailand T100 consulting team at "Grade 1" maturity (out of 4)

### 11. Key Thai Client References

| Client | Industry | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Jin Hai (金海) | Manufacturing | T100, 10+ years, BOI success story |
| Thai Kinpo (泰金宝) | Plastics (Dyson parts) | Active, eMES deployment |
| TTS | Plastics (4 factories) | Go-live planned |
| Thai Ever | Plastics pellets | Existing client |
| AMP | Plastics injection | Legacy client |
| Cheng Lun (成崙) | Plastics injection | Legacy client |
| Thai Ho Sing (泰和星) | Plastics injection | Legacy client |
| Emerald | Recycled plastics | Existing client |

### 12. Website Content Implications

**Pain-first messaging should reference:**
- "Do you know your real production cost per batch?"
- "Your whiteboard isn't telling you the truth"
- "When your customer calls about delivery, can you answer in 10 seconds?"
- "How many hours reconciling production reports?"

**Proof points:**
- Co-product cost accounting (unique)
- BOI compliance (Jin Hai: 10M THB → zero)
- COVID-era remote factory management
- Yamaha recall story (traceability urgency)
- "44 years, 50,000+ clients, 100+ Thai implementations"

**Technical terms the manufacturing audience understands:**
- OEE / Machine utilization
- BOM (Bill of Materials)
- Shop floor transparency
- Real-time kanban
- Batch traceability
- Back-flush material consumption
