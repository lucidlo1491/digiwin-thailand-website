THE 4 REVENUE STREAMS 

## How Partner Revenue Actually Works

Unlike SaaS vendors that trickle revenue over years, our model provides substantial upfront margin plus recurring income.

### License Revenue

Front-Loaded Cash Flow 

You purchase license keys at Distributor Price, sell at Suggested Selling Price (SSP). The difference is **immediate gross profit**—profitable from Day 1.

Silver Partner 
Strong margin 

Gold Partner 
Industry-leading margin 

### Service Revenue

100% Retention 

DigiWin is a product vendor, not a service competitor. **You keep 100%** of all Implementation, Customization, and Training fees.

Workflow iGP Project 
Varies by scope 

T100/MES Project 
Hourly billing 

*We "give up" this high-margin revenue to partners in exchange for market scale.*

### Recurring Support (MA)

The Annuity Stream 

You pay DigiWin a **fixed annual fee** (starting Year 2) for Tier 2 support—core bug fixes, patches, and R&D. You provide Tier 1 support and **set your own client rate**.

Your Cost to DigiWin 
Fixed annual fee 

You Charge the Client 
You set the rate 

*No profit-sharing. Your cost is fixed and predictable. You set your own client rate and keep the markup. As install base grows, MA becomes your most predictable revenue stream.*

### Upsell & Cross-Sell

Growth Multiplier 

Revenue doesn't end at Go-Live. Build IP on the **Digiwin.cloud PaaS platform**. Custom modules become licensable assets.

Module Add-ons 
Same tier-based margin 

Referral Fees 
5-10% of license 

*A single client can generate 3-4 additional license sales over 5 years.*

REALISTIC YEAR 1-2-3 SCENARIOS 

## The 3-Year Partner Journey

Conservative estimates. No hype. Here's what typical progression looks like for a partner starting with SME products.

Year 1 

### Investment & Ramp

Silver Partner (Co-Delivery) 

**Reality:** Don't expect profit in Q1-Q2. Your focus is training your core team and closing first "Pilot" deals with DigiWin's heavy assistance.

Milestones: 
Certify 2 consultants, close 2 Workflow iGP pilots 

License Revenue 
Strong margin 

Service Revenue 
100% yours 

Recurring (MA) 
฿0 (warranty period) 

Year 1 Focus 
Build foundation 

**Outcome:** Break even or small loss, but 2 reference sites and certified team. You survived the "Valley of Death."

Year 2 

### Cash Flow Phase

Transition to Gold Partner 

**Reality:** Team can now deploy iGP without hand-holding. Stop bleeding hours on learning. Introduce "Reverse Cut" strategy with MES.

New Sales: 
3 iGP projects + 1 MES standalone 

License Revenue 
Grows with volume 

Service Revenue 
100% yours 

Recurring (MA) 
Annuity begins 

Year 2 Focus 
Profitable practice 

**Outcome:** **Profitable practice.** Service revenue funds operations; license revenue is pure profit. MA covers office rent.

Year 3 

### Asset Building Phase

Gold Partner (Specialized) 

**Reality:** No longer just "hunting." The farming engine kicks in. MA covers a junior consultant's salary. First T100 or AIoT upsell attempts.

New Sales: 
4 iGP + 1 T100 Enterprise or 2 MES add-ons 

License Revenue 
Enterprise deals 

Service Revenue 
100% yours 

Recurring (MA) 
Compounding 

Year 3 Focus 
Asset, not just a job 

**Outcome:** Business valuation shifts. **You have a recurring revenue stream and sticky client base.** You built an asset, not just a job.

RISK MITIGATION 

## Your Protection Structure

Partnership isn't just about revenue—it's about protecting your investment and reducing risk.

### Territory & Conflict Protection

**6-Month Ironclad Lock:** Once you register a qualified lead, it's legally locked to you for 6 months (renewable +3). No one can approach the client.

**Structural Segmentation:** DigiWin's direct team is restricted to Chinese/Taiwanese inbound accounts. Thai Local Market is exclusively for partners.

**Non-Compete Clause:** Master Agreement explicitly states DigiWin cannot operate leads booked by partners during valid period.

"Your leads are locked. Contractual protection, not just promises." 

### Co-Implementation Support

**Tiered Support:** You own Tier 1 (user questions, basic configs). DigiWin handles Tier 2 (core bugs, API failures, R&D).

**"Entrusted Service" Safety Net:** If you sell but lack capacity, DigiWin delivers under your brand via formal agreement.

**On-Site Pilot Assistance:** For first projects, we provide on-site guidance for critical phases like Go-Live Simulation.

"You are never alone on Go-Live." 

### Training & Certification

**Mandatory Certification:** Your staff must complete Sales, Pre-sales, and Delivery certification tracks within 3-5 months.

**Role-Based Tracks:** T100 Certified → Enterprise projects. MES Certified → Factory floor. Gold Status → Highest-tier margins.

**Sales "Weaponization":** Industry whitepapers, ROI calculators, localized demo scripts—go in as manufacturing consultants.

"Competency transfer, not just manuals." 

### Demand Generation

**100% Lead Distribution:** Leads from Brand Roadshows and digital marketing are distributed 100% to qualified partners who attend.

**Gold Priority Allocation:** High-quality inbound leads are allocated based on performance to Gold Partners first.

**Division of Labor:** We generate demand; you capture and service it. We're the marketing engine; you're the closing engine.

"We feed the army."
