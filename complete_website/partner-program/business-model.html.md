Business Model Crisis 

# The Problem Isn't Your Team—It's Your Business Model

You're tired of Monday Morning Escalations and watching senior consultants act as data babysitters. The Man-Day Trap is capping your growth. You deliver Tier-1 capabilities at Tier-3 prices. This page names the problem—so you can escape it.

## You Know This Pattern

Every SI lives the same cycle. It feels productive. But it's a trap.

### Win the Project

After weeks of proposals, demos, and negotiations, you finally land a customer.

### Deliver Expertise

Your team does great work. You solve hard problems. You make them successful.

### Project Ends

Knowledge transferred. Their team can handle it. They don't need you anymore.

### Start from Zero

Back to hunting. More proposals. More negotiations. The cycle repeats.

And the cycle repeats... forever

## The Industry Evidence

This isn't anecdote. Here's the documented math of why the model is broken.

### The Profit Squeeze

Project net margins have compressed from **~35% in 2018 to ~18% in 2024**. Clients demand Tier-1 capabilities at Tier-3 prices. A 9-month project that generated ฿500k profit now generates only ~฿150k.

Same Effort = Half the Return 

### The 35-Person Cap

Boutique consultancies cannot scale beyond **35–45 employees** because delivery relies on "hero" seniors. To grow revenue, you must hire more—increasing overhead and risk with no leverage.

Revenue = Headcount (Linear Only) 

### The ฿200K Replacement Cost

Replacing a senior consultant costs **฿200,000 in recruitment plus 6 months** of lost productivity. One quitting senior can paralyze your ability to take new projects.

Talent Loss = 200K + 6 Months 

### The 65% Overrun Trap

**65% of budget overruns** come from system modifications to improve usability. This becomes "unbillable goodwill work"—fixing rigid software to fit Thai factory processes, directly eating your margin.

Goodwill Fixes = Profit Evaporates 

### The 30% Undercut

Open-source and local competitors (free ERP platforms, local accounting software) offer implementation costs **~30% lower**. Without a differentiated weapon, you're forced to compete on price—the race to the bottom.

Price War = Margin Death 

### The Shrinking Pie

Economic headwinds led to **~100 factory closures/month** in early 2024. The total addressable market is shrinking while competition for healthy clients intensifies.

Fewer Factories = More Competition 

## Three Possible Futures

You have three paths. Only one leads to sustainable growth.

### Path 1: "Work Harder"

Why this fails: You cannot outwork structural margin compression.

Senior consultants spend **50% of their time** as "data babysitters" instead of billing high-value architecture. Same effort now yields half the profit. Working harder on the same model = running faster on a treadmill.

### Path 2: "Find a Niche"

Why this is limited: You hit a ceiling on client size and technical capability.

Niche software often lacks native connectivity for **Industry 4.0**. Specializing means building heavy custom code—creating "golden handcuffs" where your best people maintain old code instead of deploying new projects. Past success becomes a prison.

### Path 3: "Change the Model"

Why this is logical: It decouples revenue from hours.

Leverage a **PaaS platform** to build reusable industry templates. Convert one-off customization into licensable IP. Enter clients via low-risk **"Reverse Cut"** (MES/AIoT first), then expand. A 35-person firm generates the revenue of a 50-person firm through technology arbitrage.

"Shift from selling hours to building assets. From labor arbitrage to technology arbitrage."

The goal isn't to sell more software—it's to stop relying on unpredictable one-off fees and build a sustainable "farming" practice based on recurring maintenance and add-on modules.

## There's Another Way

Add a product line to your services business and change the fundamental economics.

### Recurring Revenue

Software licenses and maintenance generate predictable monthly income. Sleep on vacation. Revenue keeps coming in.

Monthly Revenue = License Base × Rate 

### Sticky Relationships

When customers run their factory on your software, they don't leave. You become critical infrastructure, not a replaceable vendor.

Churn Rate → Near Zero 

### Compound Growth

Year 2 = Year 1 customers + new customers. Each deal adds to your base. The math finally works in your favor over time.

Year N = Year N-1 + New Wins 

## Side-by-Side Comparison

Comparison of Services Only vs Services + Product business models 

Metric 
Services Only 
Services + Product 

Revenue Model 
Resets to zero each year 
Compounds annually 

Customer Relationship 
Project-based, ends 
Ongoing, permanent 

Revenue Predictability 
Feast or famine 
Predictable base + growth 

Business Valuation 
1-2x revenue (if any) 
5-10x recurring revenue 

Owner Dependence 
Business = You 
Business = Customer base 

Growth Ceiling 
Limited by headcount 
Limited by market size
