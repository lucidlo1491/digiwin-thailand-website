The Challenge 

## Your Machines Are Running — But You Can't See What They're Doing

Most factories have machines running 24/7, but the data those machines generate never makes it into a system anyone can act on. Operators manually log production counts on clipboards. Downtime is recorded on paper — if it's recorded at all. And OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) calculations happen in Excel spreadsheets, days after the fact, based on numbers everyone knows are estimates.

The gap between what your machines actually produce and what your system records is where profit leaks. Unplanned downtime goes undetected for hours. Quality defects get caught at end-of-line instead of at the source. And when management asks "what's our OEE?", the answer is a guess — not a measurement.

This workshop teaches you how to close that gap. You'll work with real MES modules and IoT devices to build a **live data pipeline from the shop floor to a dashboard** — and you'll see production data update in real-time as machines run.

Workshop Outcomes 

## What You'll Be Able to Do After This Workshop

### Configure MES data collection points for your specific machines

Set up the exact data collection parameters your shop floor needs — production counts, cycle times, and machine states mapped to your equipment.

### Connect IoT sensors to capture production counts, downtime, and quality data

Physically wire sensors to equipment interfaces and validate that machine signals are being captured correctly in the MES system.

### Build a live OEE dashboard that updates in real-time

Create a working dashboard showing Availability, Performance, and Quality metrics that refresh automatically as production data flows in.

### Create alert rules for production anomalies

Configure threshold-based alerts that notify the right people when downtime exceeds limits, quality rates drop, or cycle times deviate from standards.

Full-Day Agenda 

## Build It Yourself — Not Watch Someone Else Do It

Every session puts your hands on real MES modules and IoT hardware. You'll leave with working configurations, not just slide decks.

09:00 – 09:30 

### Registration & Setup

Laptops required. Environment setup, software access, and a quick survey of your current shop floor data collection methods.

09:30 – 10:30 

### MES Architecture — How Data Flows from Machine to Dashboard

Understanding the data pipeline: sensor signals, edge gateways, MES collection points, and how OEE is calculated from raw machine events.

10:30 – 10:45 

### Coffee Break

10:45 – 12:00 

### Hands-On: Configuring Data Collection Points

Working in the MES system, you'll define machine profiles, map signal types, and configure the data collection parameters for different equipment types.

12:00 – 13:00 

### Networking Lunch

13:00 – 14:30 

### Hands-On: Connecting Sensors & Building Your First OEE Dashboard

Connect IoT sensors to simulated machine interfaces, validate data flow, and build a real-time OEE dashboard showing Availability, Performance, and Quality.

14:30 – 14:45 

### Coffee Break

14:45 – 15:30 

### Alert Configuration & Anomaly Detection

Set up threshold-based alerts for downtime, quality deviations, and cycle time anomalies. Learn how to route notifications to the right people at the right time.

15:30 – 16:00 

### Q&A + Implementation Planning

Open discussion, individual architecture questions, and planning your shop floor data collection rollout back at your factory.

Who This Is For 

## Is This Workshop Right for You?

IT / System Administrator 
Evaluating MES for the Factory 

You're the person management will ask to evaluate and implement MES. You need to understand the technical architecture — network requirements, sensor protocols, data storage — before you can recommend it.

"I need to understand the technical architecture before recommending MES to management."

Production Engineer 
Any Size Manufacturing 

You run the production line and you know the data your operators record on paper is incomplete and late. You want machines to report their own status — automatically, accurately, in real-time.

"I want to capture machine data automatically instead of relying on operators to fill in forms."

Continuous Improvement Manager 
Lean / Six Sigma Practitioner 

Your improvement projects depend on accurate data, but the OEE numbers you've been working with are estimates based on operator logs. You need real measurements to drive real improvements.

"I need real OEE numbers, not the estimates we've been using."
