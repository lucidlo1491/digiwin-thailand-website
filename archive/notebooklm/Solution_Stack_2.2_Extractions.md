*Product portfolio framed as high-margin business assets for partners*

---

## Core Narrative

> **"Stop building custom code. Start deploying a modular arsenal."**

---

## Step 1: Portfolio as Business Model

*Sources: Digiwin Ecosystem Engine, Distributor Price Sheets, SWOT Analysis*

### 1. T100 ERP: The "Tier-1 Killer" (Enterprise Asset)

#### The Selling Angle (Market Need)
> You can now win the "Big Fish" accounts—the multi-site, multi-currency automotive and electronics suppliers—that usually go to SAP or Oracle. T100 allows you to offer **"Tier-1 capability at Tier-2 pricing,"** specifically targeting the influx of Chinese/Taiwanese EV supply chain factories that need bilingual support and complex costing out of the box.

**Target Client:** Multi-site corporations, automotive Tier-1 suppliers, electronics OEMs with 200+ employees.

---

#### Your Revenue Model
> This is your **"High-Value Project"** engine.

| Revenue Stream | Detail |
|----------------|--------|
| **License** | High ticket value (Enterprise pricing) with ~40-50% margin |
| **Services** | You keep **100% of implementation fees**, which are substantial due to multi-site finance and supply chain configuration complexity |

---

#### The Cross-Sell Path
> T100 is the backbone. Once installed, it creates an immediate necessity for **eMES** (to feed accurate production data) and **BPM** (to manage the complex approval workflows of a large organization).

**Lifecycle Value:** T100 → eMES → WMS → AIoT → BPM

---

### 2. Workflow iGP: The "Volume Engine" (SME Cash Flow)

#### The Selling Angle (Market Need)
> This is the "Rapid Deployment" weapon for the Thai SME market (20-200 users). It addresses the massive "Automation Gap" where local accounting software fails to handle production logic, but global ERPs are too expensive and rigid. It is **pre-localized for Thai taxation (Revenue Dept. certified)**, making it an easy sell to Finance Directors.

**Target Client:** Thai SMEs (20-200 employees), family-owned manufacturers, first-time ERP adopters.

---

#### Your Revenue Model
> This is your **"Cash Flow"** engine.

| Revenue Stream | Detail |
|----------------|--------|
| **Speed** | Designed for 3-6 month deployments, allowing you to turn over projects faster and bill sooner, avoiding the "long project death" that kills cash flow |
| **Volume** | Lower barrier to entry allows you to capture a higher volume of local manufacturers who are modernizing for Industry 4.0 tax incentives |

---

#### The Cross-Sell Path
> Start here to digitize the "Office." Once the finance/admin side is stable, the logical next step is to digitize the "Factory" with **eMES** to fix the manual data entry errors that plague the ERP.

**Lifecycle Value:** iGP → eMES → WMS → AIoT

---

### 3. eMES (Essential MES): The "Strategic Wedge" (Retention Asset)

#### The Selling Angle (Market Need)
> The **"Reverse Cut" Strategy.** You don't have to rip and replace their existing ERP (even if it's SAP) to win a deal. Sell eMES as the "Shop Floor Enforcer" that fixes their inventory accuracy and OEE tracking. It appeals to owners who are tired of "Shadow Excel" and want real-time visibility without a massive ERP migration.

**Target Client:** Factories frustrated with current ERP rigidity, SAP/Oracle accounts seeking shop-floor visibility, second-generation owners wanting Industry 4.0.

---

#### Your Revenue Model
> This is your **"Sticky Recurring"** engine.

| Revenue Stream | Detail |
|----------------|--------|
| **Services** | Heavy focus on process consulting and hardware integration (scanners, IoT), which commands premium "expert" rates |
| **Retention** | Once you control the shop floor data, the client cannot leave you. It creates a much higher barrier to exit than a standard accounting system |

---

#### The Cross-Sell Path
> It acts as a "Trojan Horse." By controlling the production data, you eventually expose the weaknesses of their legacy ERP, positioning yourself to replace it with **T100** or **iGP** later.

**Lifecycle Value:** eMES (entry) → WMS → AIoT → T100/iGP (replacement)

---

### 4. AIoT & WMS: The "Value Multipliers" (Differentiation)

#### The Selling Angle (Market Need)

**WMS — "Zero Ghost Inventory":**
> Sell this to owners terrified of theft or audit failure. It digitizes the physical movement of goods, solving the "system says 100, shelf has 50" problem.

**AIoT — "Future Proofing":**
> Even if they aren't ready today, showing you have the *capability* to connect machines (PLCs) directly to the ERP differentiates you from local accounting firms that only know debits and credits.

---

#### Your Revenue Model

| Revenue Stream | Detail |
|----------------|--------|
| **Hardware/Middleware** | Opportunity to resell or partner on hardware (handhelds, sensors) and the integration services to connect them |
| **Data Services** | Potential for recurring revenue monitoring and optimization services based on the data stream |

---

#### The Cross-Sell Path
> These are the ultimate "Lock-in" layers. A client using your WMS scanners and IoT sensors is physically integrated with your business, securing the maintenance annuity for years.

**Retention Logic:** Physical integration (scanners, sensors, PLCs) creates 10+ year client relationships.

---

### Portfolio Strategy Summary: "Land and Expand"

| Phase | Product | Purpose | Revenue Type |
|-------|---------|---------|--------------|
| **1. Land** | iGP (Volume) or eMES (Reverse Cut) | Entry point | Project fees + License |
| **2. Stabilize** | WMS | Control & accuracy | Project + Hardware |
| **3. Expand** | T100 | Scale to enterprise | High-value project |
| **4. Lock** | AIoT | Retention & recurring | Subscription + Data services |

> *This framing proves to Khun Somchai that you aren't just giving him software; you are giving him a **Customer Lifecycle Management** strategy.*

---

## Step 2: The Reverse Cut Entry Strategy

*Sources: Vice President Strategy Transcripts, Presale Training Recordings, Product Integration Documents*

### 1. How It Works Practically: "The Shop Floor Trojan Horse"

Instead of pitching a "Big Bang" ERP replacement (which scares the CFO and requires massive budget), you pitch a **"Production Visibility Overlay."**

---

#### The Wedge
> You sell **eMES (Essential MES)** or **AIoT** as a specialized module to solve a specific "Factory Floor" pain that the incumbent ERP is failing to handle—specifically **Machine Data Collection**, **Real-Time WIP Tracking**, or **OEE Monitoring**.

**The Pitch:** "Keep SAP for Finance. Use Digiwin for the factory floor."

---

#### The Integration
> You do not rip out their SAP/Oracle. You sit *underneath* it. You connect Digiwin eMES to their machines (via IoT/PLC) to capture actual production data (counts, cycle times, downtime).

**Technical Reality:** Digiwin MES can integrate with any ERP via API or structured data export.

---

#### The Data Flow
> You feed clean, validated production data *up* to their existing ERP (via API or Excel export), fixing the "Garbage In, Garbage Out" problem that has been plaguing their Finance team for years.

**The Value Proposition:** "We make your current ERP investment work better."

---

### 2. Why It Reduces Sales Friction: "Bypassing the Immune System"

This strategy neutralizes the three biggest barriers to a sale:

---

#### It Avoids the "Sunk Cost" Objection
> The owner doesn't have to admit their 10-million Baht SAP investment was a mistake. You position Digiwin as the **"Manufacturing Accelerator"** that *makes SAP work better*, not as a replacement.

**What you DON'T say:** "Your SAP was a bad decision."
**What you DO say:** "SAP is great for finance. Let us handle the factory floor."

---

#### It Targets a Desperate Buyer
> You stop selling to the Finance Director (who only cares about compliance) and start selling to the **Factory Manager** or **Second-Gen Owner** (who is desperate for real-time control and tired of "Shadow Excel").

**VP Quote:** *"ERP gets a zero score in production demos; MES gets the score because it solves the 'Blind Box' problem immediately."*

---

#### It Lowers the Risk Threshold
> An eMES implementation is faster, cheaper (~1M THB vs 5M+ THB), and less disruptive than a full ERP project. It allows the partner to prove competence with a "Quick Win."

| Metric | Full ERP | eMES Entry |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Budget** | 5M+ THB | ~1M THB |
| **Timeline** | 9-18 months | 3-6 months |
| **Disruption** | High (rip-and-replace) | Low (overlay) |
| **Risk** | High | Low |

---

### 3. The Expansion Path: "Surround and Conquer"

Once you are inside the factory controlling the *real* data (production flow, inventory movement, machine status), the expansion logic is inevitable:

---

#### Phase 1: The Wedge
> Implement eMES to fix production data accuracy. The client sees immediate ROI in reduced downtime and accurate costing data.

**Client Experience:** "Finally, I can see what's actually happening on the floor."

---

#### Phase 2: The Contrast
> The client eventually realizes that while Digiwin eMES is flexible and "manufacturing-native," their legacy ERP (SAP/Odoo) is rigid and slow to update. The "integration tax" of maintaining two systems becomes annoying.

**Client Experience:** "Why is updating SAP so painful when Digiwin just works?"

---

#### Phase 3: The Replacement
> When the legacy ERP needs an upgrade or license renewal, you propose **T100 ERP**. You argue: *"You already run your factory on Digiwin. Why not run your books on it too and eliminate the integration headache?"*

**Client Experience:** "Let's just consolidate everything on Digiwin."

---

#### The Partner Benefit
> This turns a "No, we already have SAP" rejection into a "Yes, we need to fix our shop floor" opportunity, creating a recurring revenue stream that eventually consumes the entire account.

**Strategic Summary:**
> *"Don't fight the castle (SAP/Oracle) at the front gate. Enter through the factory door with MES, make yourself indispensable to operations, and win the ERP business from the inside out."*

---

## Step 3: Competitive Positioning for Partners

*Sources: Digiwin Ecosystem Engine, SWOT Analysis, VP Strategy Transcripts, Competitor Analysis*

### 1. Positioning Against "Generic" ERPs (SAP Business One / NetSuite)

**The Angle:** *"They stop at the office door; we run the factory floor."*

---

#### The Manufacturing Void
> "SAP Business One and NetSuite are excellent *financial* systems, but in Thailand, they are often implemented as 'Trading Companies with a Factory attached.' They treat manufacturing as simple kitting. They struggle with the reality of Thai production: **mold management, regrind (scrap reuse), and complex sub-contracting loops**. We handle these natively without expensive add-ons."

**Use when:** Client has SAP B1/NetSuite but complains about production visibility.

---

#### The "Phantom" Problem
> "Competitors often force you to create thousands of 'dummy' inventory transactions just to track a sub-assembly that is built and consumed immediately (Phantom BOMs). Digiwin's T100 manages this logic automatically, keeping your warehouse data clean and your finance team happy."

**Use when:** Client mentions complex BOMs or WIP tracking issues.

---

#### The Cost of "Good Enough"
> "To make NetSuite handle deep manufacturing, you often need 3rd party extensions (SuiteApps). This increases your Total Cost of Ownership and creates 'version lock' risks during upgrades. Digiwin's manufacturing modules (MES, WMS) are native and pre-integrated."

**Use when:** Client is evaluating NetSuite with add-ons.

---

### 2. Positioning Against "Global Enterprise" Giants (SAP S/4HANA / Oracle)

**The Angle:** *"Tier-1 Capability without the Tier-1 'German Logic'."*

---

#### Agility vs. Rigidity
> "SAP forces your Thai factory to follow rigid 'German Logic'—linear processes that break when a rush order arrives or a machine fails. Digiwin T100 is built for **Asian manufacturing flexibility**: we handle urgent order splitting and mid-production changes without requiring you to roll back the entire month's schedule."

**Use when:** Client complains about SAP's inflexibility for rush orders.

---

#### Total Cost Advantage
> "We deliver **90% of the Tier-1 capability** (multi-site, multi-currency, inter-company) at **~70% of the price**. More importantly, our implementation timelines are shorter (6-9 months vs. 12-18 months) because we use pre-built industry templates for Automotive and Electronics, not blank-slate consulting."

**Use when:** Client is evaluating SAP/Oracle but has budget concerns.

---

#### The "Hidden" License Fee
> "Unlike Oracle, where audit risks and 'named user' costs can spiral, Digiwin offers a **transparent pricing model** designed for high-volume manufacturing environments where you need shop floor users to access data without buying expensive full licenses."

**Use when:** Client mentions Oracle license audit fears.

---

### 3. Positioning Against "Local" & Open Source (Thai Vendors / Odoo)

**The Angle:** *"Scale without the 'Dead End' Risk."*

---

#### The "Vanishing Vendor" Risk
> "Local ERPs are cheap (~30% less), but they lack the R&D budget to survive the next technology shift (AI, IoT). Digiwin is a **publicly listed company (Stock Code: 300378)** with 43 years of history and Foxconn backing. You are betting your company's future; do you want to bet it on a vendor that might not be here in 5 years?"

**Use when:** Client is tempted by low-cost local options.

---

#### The "Feature Ceiling"
> "Odoo is great for starting out, but it hits a 'complexity wall.' When you need **real-time machine integration (IoT)** or **traceability for ISO/IATF audits**, local software requires heavy custom coding. Digiwin has these standards built-in, creating a bridge to Industry 4.0 that local software cannot build."

**Use when:** Client mentions future IoT or audit requirements.

---

#### Financial Credibility
> "Your bank and your auditors know Digiwin. Using a recognized regional standard like T100 or iGP helps with **IPO preparation and loan approvals** in ways that custom-built local software cannot."

**Use when:** Client is preparing for investment, acquisition, or IPO.

---

## The Partner's "Ace Card"

When cornered, the winning argument:

> **"SAP manages your General Ledger. Local software manages your Invoices. Digiwin manages your *Factory Floor*. We are the only ones who understand that the physical reality of a Thai production line doesn't always match the accounting rules."**

---
