        <!-- Opening -->
        <p class="fade-in">
            After visiting hundreds of factories across Thailand, a pattern emerges. The products are different — auto parts, electronics, plastics, food — but the frustrations are the same. Five problems show up in almost every conversation with factory owners. These pain points don't discriminate by industry, company size, or product complexity. They are universal symptoms of a deeper structural issue: the gap between how manufacturing systems work and how manufacturing actually happens.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            This article comes from DigiWin's presale methodology — the framework our team uses in every factory visit to understand where operations are breaking down. These five questions surface the problems that Thai manufacturers live with every day, often without realizing they're solvable.
        </p>

        <hr class="blog-divider fade-in">

        <!-- Pain Point 1: Cost Opacity -->
        <h2 class="fade-in">Pain Point 1: Cost Opacity</h2>

        <p class="fade-in">
            <strong>"Do you know your real production cost per batch?"</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            Most factory owners know their average cost. Few know their batch-to-batch cost. Material prices fluctuate, yield rates vary, rework happens. Without batch-level costing, you're pricing based on averages — and averages hide losses. One batch might profit 20%, the next loses 5%, and the monthly report shows a comfortable 8% margin that masks the volatility underneath.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            The problem compounds when customers demand pricing adjustments or when you're bidding on new contracts. You look at last quarter's average cost and add a margin. But that average includes your best batches and your worst batches. If the new order happens to hit during a period of high material costs or lower-than-expected yield, your comfortable margin evaporates — and you don't find out until the order is complete and the margin analysis comes back negative.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            Cost opacity isn't just an accounting problem. It's a strategic blind spot. You can't optimize what you can't see. You can't quote confidently when you don't know your real costs. And you can't identify which products, customers, or production runs are actually profitable versus which ones are subsidized by the profitable ones.
        </p>

        <!-- Pain Point 2: Production Transparency -->
        <h2 class="fade-in">Pain Point 2: Production Transparency</h2>

        <p class="fade-in">
            <strong>"What's happening on your shop floor right now?"</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            The owner's office is 50 meters from the production floor, but the information gap is enormous. Production reports arrive at end of shift — or end of day. By then, problems have compounded. Machine downtime went unnoticed for 45 minutes. A quality issue affected 200 units before anyone flagged it. The whiteboard schedule was outdated by 10am.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            This lack of real-time visibility creates a reactive management style. Problems are discovered after they've already created impact. A machine breakdown that should have been addressed in 10 minutes becomes a 45-minute delay because no one in the office knew it happened. A material shortage that should have been flagged when the inventory hit the reorder point becomes a production stoppage because the planning team was working from yesterday's data.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            The consequence is constant firefighting. Your production managers spend their day responding to issues that are already impacting output, rather than preventing issues before they cascade. And when a customer calls asking about order status, the answer requires a phone call to the floor supervisor, who checks the whiteboard, who estimates based on visual inspection. Ten minutes later, you have an approximate answer — while your competitor with production visibility answered the same question in 10 seconds.
        </p>

        <!-- Pain Point 3: Paper-Based Fraud -->
        <h2 class="fade-in">Pain Point 3: Paper-Based Reporting Gaps</h2>

        <p class="fade-in">
            <strong>"How many hours do you spend reconciling production reports?"</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            This is the uncomfortable one. Paper-based production reporting is not just slow and inaccurate — it's manipulable. Production quantities get rounded up. Scrap rates get rounded down. Material consumption gets estimated rather than measured. Not because workers are dishonest, but because manual reporting creates gaps that naturally get filled with approximations.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            When a production order closes, the floor supervisor fills out a paper form: quantity produced, material consumed, time elapsed. These numbers come from memory, estimates, and rough counts. The form goes to data entry. Data entry types it into the system. Days later, when the accounting team tries to reconcile inventory, the numbers don't match. Material consumption is higher than reported production should require. Finished goods inventory doesn't align with production reports. Hours worked exceed what the production log shows.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            The factory then spends days investigating these gaps — pulling warehouse records, interviewing floor supervisors, comparing batch records. Sometimes the discrepancies are innocent estimation errors. Sometimes they reveal systematic underreporting of scrap or material waste. Either way, management is making decisions based on data that diverges from physical reality — and discovering the divergence only after the fact, when it's too late to correct.
        </p>

        <div class="blog-pullquote fade-in">
            Paper-based production reporting isn't just slow — it creates data gaps that get filled with approximations, estimates, and memory. By the time the numbers reach management, they've already diverged from reality.
        </div>

        <!-- Pain Point 4: Planning vs Reality Disconnect -->
        <h2 class="fade-in">Pain Point 4: Planning vs. Reality Disconnect</h2>

        <p class="fade-in">
            <strong>"Does your production plan survive first contact with the shop floor?"</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            Plans are made Monday morning. By Monday afternoon, a machine is down, a material delivery is late, and a rush order has arrived. The carefully built schedule is obsolete. Replanning takes hours. Meanwhile, the floor supervisor has already made adjustments by instinct — changes that planning doesn't know about until the next day.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            This disconnect creates two parallel realities: the plan that lives in the system, and the reality that lives on the shop floor. The ERP says Order A should be complete by 3pm. The floor supervisor knows it won't finish until 5pm because of the machine issue, so they've already started Order B on a different line. But planning is still working from the original schedule, telling customers that Order A will ship today — a promise that can't be kept.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            The problem compounds when multiple disruptions happen simultaneously. A supplier delay affects three orders. A quality issue requires rework on a batch that was supposed to ship tomorrow. A key operator calls in sick. The floor supervisor juggles all of this through experience and instinct, making dozens of micro-decisions throughout the day. But none of those decisions flow back into the planning system. So when the planning team builds tomorrow's schedule, they're building it on top of a foundation that no longer reflects reality.
        </p>

        <!-- Pain Point 5: Delivery Accuracy -->
        <h2 class="fade-in">Pain Point 5: Delivery Accuracy</h2>

        <p class="fade-in">
            <strong>"When your customer calls about their order, can you answer in 10 seconds?"</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            The ultimate test of operational visibility. A customer calls at 2pm asking about delivery status. Your salesperson puts them on hold, calls the planning department, who calls the production floor, who checks the whiteboard. Ten minutes later — if the right person is available — you have an approximate answer. Meanwhile, your competitor with real-time production visibility answered the same question in 10 seconds.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            Delivery accuracy isn't just about logistics. It's about trust. When you tell a customer their order will ship Wednesday and it actually ships Friday, you've damaged the relationship — even if the delay was caused by factors outside your control. Because from the customer's perspective, you made a promise and didn't keep it. And if it happens repeatedly, they start building buffer time into their expectations or looking for more reliable suppliers.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            The deeper issue is that delivery accuracy depends on every other pain point being solved. You can't promise accurate delivery dates if you don't know your real production costs (Pain Point 1), can't see what's happening on the floor in real-time (Pain Point 2), are working from inaccurate production data (Pain Point 3), and have a planning system that doesn't reflect shop floor reality (Pain Point 4). Delivery accuracy is the symptom. The other four pain points are the disease.
        </p>

            <div class="blog-data-card-content">

                    When your ERP, shop floor, and warehouse speak different languages, every decision is based on delayed, approximated data.
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <hr class="blog-divider fade-in">

        <!-- Closing -->
        <h2 class="fade-in">The Common Thread</h2>

        <p class="fade-in">
            These aren't five separate problems that each require a different solution. They're five symptoms of the same underlying issue: <strong>disconnected systems</strong>. Your ERP knows what should happen according to the plan. Your MES (if you have one) knows what happened on the shop floor. Your warehouse system knows what inventory was issued and received. But these systems don't talk to each other in real-time. So every decision — costing, planning, delivery promises, production adjustments — is made on data that's already outdated, incomplete, or approximated.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            The solution isn't working harder. It's connecting the systems that already exist in your factory. When production data flows from the machine to the ERP to the dashboard in real-time, all five pain points begin to dissolve. Not overnight, but systematically.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
            Cost opacity disappears when actual material consumption and labor hours are captured at the production order level, not estimated from a standard BOM. Production transparency emerges when shop floor data updates the ERP in real-time, not at end of shift. Paper-based reporting gaps close when operators scan barcodes or tap touchscreens instead of filling out forms. Planning-reality disconnects shrink when the planning system pulls live production status instead of yesterday's report. And delivery accuracy improves because you're no longer guessing — you're looking at actual data.
        </p>

        <div class="blog-pullquote fade-in">
            Every factory has these five problems. The question isn't whether they exist — it's how much they're costing you in margins, delivery penalties, and lost customers.
        </div>

        <p class="fade-in">
            The manufacturers that solve these pain points don't do it by hiring more people or working longer hours. They do it by closing the gap between their systems and their shop floor reality. And once that gap closes, these five universal problems stop being inevitable costs of doing business and start being competitive advantages.
