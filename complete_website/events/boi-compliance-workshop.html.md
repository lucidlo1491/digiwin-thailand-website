The Challenge 

## Your Finance Team Spends Weeks Preparing for Every BOI Audit

If your factory holds a BOI certificate — and if you're a manufacturer in Thailand, you almost certainly do — your compliance team is fighting a battle every audit cycle. They're manually reconciling import declarations against production records, building spreadsheets outside your ERP, and hoping the numbers align.

The root cause is architectural: most ERP systems calculate material consumption from theoretical BOMs. But the **BOI board doesn't audit your BOM** — they audit your actual production consumption, order by order, material by material. When your system can't show that level of detail, the gap between theory and reality becomes supplementary tax.

One factory was paying over **10 million baht per year** in that gap. This workshop shows you exactly how they eliminated it.

Who This Is For 

## Is This Workshop Right for You?

Factory CFO / Finance Director 
50-500 Employees, BOI-Certified 

You sign off on BOI compliance filings and worry about audit results every cycle. You need to understand your factory's compliance exposure.

"I need to know our compliance exposure — and whether our ERP is hiding gaps."

Production Manager / Plant Manager 
Any Size, BOI-Certified 

You run the shop floor and your data feeds the compliance reports. Production accuracy directly impacts your factory's BOI standing.

"I need my production data to match what finance reports — but right now it doesn't."

ERP / IT Manager 
Evaluating or Upgrading ERP 

You manage the system that's supposed to produce BOI reports. You need to know what production-order-level tracking actually requires.

"I need to know what production-order-level tracking actually requires from a system."
