## What is AIoT (Artificial Intelligence + Internet of Things)?

AIoT is technology that connects factory machines and sensors to collect real-time production data, then applies AI analytics to predict maintenance needs and optimize efficiency. It turns raw machine signals into actionable intelligence — letting you prevent breakdowns before they happen instead of reacting after the fact.

**DigiWin AIoT** is an industrial IoT platform that connects any machine, any protocol, to a unified data layer. Supporting 50+ industrial protocols — including OPC-UA, Modbus, MQTT, Fanuc, Siemens, and Mitsubishi — it captures over 1 million data points per day from CNC machines, PLCs, sensors, and energy meters. The platform enables real-time OEE monitoring, predictive maintenance, energy management, and environmental tracking, delivering an average 15% OEE improvement and 40% reduction in unplanned downtime for Thai factories.

## Most Factories Are Flying Blind

Your machines talk. But without the right ears, you're missing critical intelligence.

### Silent Machines

Machines run without reporting. Problems only surface after breakdowns.

### Reactive Maintenance

Fix it when it breaks. Unplanned downtime costs 10x more than scheduled maintenance.

### Manual OEE

Staff tracking production on clipboards. Data is late, inaccurate, or simply not collected.

### Hidden Energy Waste

No visibility into which machines consume what. Energy costs spike unexplained.

## Frequently Asked Questions

What is Industrial AIoT? + 

Industrial AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things) combines IoT sensor connectivity with AI-driven analytics for manufacturing. It connects factory machines, PLCs, and sensors to a unified data platform that monitors equipment health, calculates OEE automatically, predicts failures before they happen, and optimizes energy consumption — turning raw machine data into actionable intelligence.

What machines and protocols does DigiWin AIoT support? + 

DigiWin AIoT supports 50+ industrial protocols including OPC-UA, Modbus TCP/RTU, MQTT, MT Connect, PROFINET, EtherNet/IP, Siemens S7, Mitsubishi MELSEC, FANUC FOCAS, Allen-Bradley, Omron FINS, and BACnet. It connects to CNC machines, injection molding machines, PLCs, robots, energy meters, and environmental sensors from any brand and any age.

Do I need to replace my existing machines to use AIoT? + 

No. DigiWin AIoT retrofits onto existing equipment regardless of age or brand. Edge devices connect to machine control interfaces (PLCs, CNCs) or add external sensors (vibration, temperature, power) to machines without digital outputs. Even 20-year-old equipment can be connected without any modification to the machine itself.

How does AIoT connect to ERP and MES? + 

DigiWin AIoT is built on the same platform as DigiWin ERP and MES, sharing one database. Machine data flows automatically from sensors through AIoT into MES for OEE calculations and into ERP for maintenance work orders and production costing. No middleware, no manual data entry, no integration projects required.

What ROI can I expect from factory AIoT? + 

DigiWin AIoT customers typically achieve a 15% OEE improvement, 40% reduction in unplanned downtime, and 12% energy cost savings. Most factories see payback within 6–12 months. The immediate wins come from eliminating manual data collection and making machine status visible in real time.
