The "Strategic Wedge" 

### MES

The **"Reverse Cut" Strategy.** You don't have to rip and replace their existing ERP—even if it's a global brand. Sell MES as the "Shop Floor Enforcer" that fixes inventory accuracy and OEE tracking. Appeals to owners tired of "Shadow Excel" wanting real-time visibility.

- "Keep your current ERP for Finance. Use Digiwin for the factory floor."

- Premium rates for process consulting & hardware integration

- Once you control shop floor data, client cannot leave

- **"Trojan Horse":** MES → WMS → AIoT → T100/iGP

THE REVERSE CUT STRATEGY 

## How to Win Enterprise ERP Accounts

Don't fight the castle at the front gate. Enter through the factory door with MES, make yourself indispensable, and win the ERP business from the inside out.

Phase 1 

### The Wedge

Sell MES as the "Shop Floor Enforcer" that fixes production data accuracy. **"Keep their current ERP for Finance. Use Digiwin for the factory floor."**

Client Experience: 
"Finally, I can see what's actually happening on the floor." 

Phase 2 

### The Contrast

Client realizes Digiwin MES is flexible and "manufacturing-native" while their legacy ERP is rigid. The "integration tax" of maintaining two systems becomes annoying.

Client Experience: 
"Why is updating our legacy ERP so painful when Digiwin just works?" 

Phase 3 

### The Replacement

When legacy ERP needs upgrade or license renewal, propose T100. **"You already run your factory on Digiwin. Why not run your books on it too?"**

Client Experience: 
"Let's just consolidate everything on Digiwin." 

#### Why It Works: Lower Risk Threshold

COMPETITIVE POSITIONING 

## Your Talking Points for Sales Conversations

How to position DigiWin against the competition in any sales conversation.

vs. Mid-Market ERP Systems 

### "They Stop at the Office Door"

**The Manufacturing Void:** Mid-market ERP systems treat manufacturing as simple kitting. They struggle with Thai production realities—mold management, regrind (scrap reuse), complex sub-contracting loops. We handle these natively.

**The Phantom Problem:** Generic ERPs force you to create thousands of 'dummy' inventory transactions for Phantom BOMs. Digiwin manages this automatically, keeping warehouse data clean.

**The Cost of "Good Enough":** To make generic ERP handle deep manufacturing, you need 3rd-party add-ons. This increases TCO and creates "version lock" risks. Digiwin's MES/WMS are native.

**Use when:** Client has a mid-market ERP but complains about production visibility. 

vs. Enterprise ERP Giants 

### "Tier-1 Capability, No German Logic"

**Agility vs. Rigidity:** Enterprise ERP systems often enforce rigid, linear processes that break when rush orders arrive or machines fail. Digiwin T100 handles urgent order splitting and mid-production changes without rolling back schedules.

**Total Cost Advantage:** We deliver 90% of Tier-1 capability at ~70% of the price. Shorter implementation (6-9 months vs. 12-18 months) using pre-built Automotive/Electronics templates.

**Transparent Pricing:** No audit risks, no spiraling "named user" costs. Digiwin offers transparent pricing for high-volume shop floor users.

**Use when:** Client is evaluating enterprise ERP but has budget concerns or flexibility needs. 

vs. Local Vendors & Open-Source 

### "Scale Without the Dead End"

**The Vanishing Vendor:** Local ERPs are 30% cheaper but lack R&D budget to survive the next tech shift (AI, IoT). Digiwin is publicly listed (300378) with 44 years of history and Foxconn backing.

**The Feature Ceiling:** Open-source ERP hits a complexity wall when you need real-time machine integration (IoT) or traceability for ISO/IATF audits. Digiwin has these built-in.

**Financial Credibility:** Your bank and auditors know Digiwin. Using T100 or iGP helps with IPO preparation and loan approvals in ways custom-built local software cannot.

**Use when:** Client is tempted by low-cost local options or open-source alternatives. 

THE ACE CARD 

"Enterprise ERP manages your General Ledger. Local software manages your Invoices. **Digiwin manages your Factory Floor.** We are the only ones who understand that the physical reality of a Thai production line doesn't always match the accounting rules."
