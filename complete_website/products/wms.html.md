## What is WMS (Warehouse Management System)?

A Warehouse Management System (WMS) is software that manages warehouse operations including receiving, storage, picking, packing, and shipping. With barcode and RFID tracking, a WMS provides real-time inventory accuracy — so you always know exactly what you have and where it is.

**DigiWin WMS**, powered by the **sFLS** platform, brings smart inventory management to manufacturing warehouses in Thailand. It replaces manual stock checks and paper-based tracking with barcode/RFID scanning, automated FIFO/FEFO enforcement, location intelligence, and wave picking optimization — covering inbound, production, and outbound warehouse operations end to end.

## The Warehouse Chaos Problem

Sound familiar? Every station has its own nightmare.

Purchase & Arrival 

### "It's Here But Not in the System"

Purchase orders arrive but receiving is manual — paper logs, miscounts, delayed PO matching. Materials sit on the dock while item data hasn't updated.

Inventory 

### "System Says 500, Shelf Says 340"

Physical counts vs. system counts are always different. Year-end reconciliation becomes a nightmare that takes the whole team.

Picking 

### "Wrong Part — They Look the Same"

Picking errors caused by similar specifications. Visual similarity is not a picking system. Costs you customer trust and expensive returns.

Quality Inspection 

### "Where's That QC Report?"

Quality checks happen in a black box — no visibility into inspection status or pass rates until it's too late. Materials sit in limbo between receiving and storage.

Packing & Shipping 

### "We Shipped the Wrong One Again"

Packing is error-prone without system guidance — wrong items, wrong quantities, missed shipments. Customers get the wrong item, you eat the return cost.

Stock Rotation 

### "FIFO? We Try..."

First-in-first-out is the rule. Reality: oldest stock hides in the back while new stock gets picked first. Expired inventory discovered too late.

Warehouse management designed for manufacturing

### Location Intelligence

Every item has an address

System knows exactly where to put it and where to find it. No more searching. No more guessing.

- Zone/aisle/shelf/bin structure

- Suggested putaway locations based on rules

- Directed picking paths for efficiency

- Visual warehouse maps

### Barcode/RFID Driven

Scan-based accuracy

Scan-based transactions eliminate data entry errors. Every move is recorded. Real-time accuracy.

- Mobile device support (Android/iOS)

- RFID capability for high-volume

- Real-time inventory updates

- Error prevention with scan validation

### FIFO/FEFO Automation

Automatic stock rotation

System enforces first-in-first-out or first-expired-first-out. No more expired stock hiding in the back.

- Lot tracking with receiving dates

- Expiry date management

- Automatic pick sequencing

- Expiry alerts and reports

### Wave Picking

Optimized fulfillment

Batch similar orders together. Optimize picker routes. Get more shipments out with the same team.

- Order batching by criteria

- Route optimization algorithms

- Labor efficiency tracking

- Pick-to-cart and pick-to-pallet

## Frequently Asked Questions

What is a Warehouse Management System (WMS)? + 

A Warehouse Management System (WMS) is software that controls and optimizes warehouse operations — from receiving and putaway to picking, packing, and shipping. Unlike distribution-focused WMS solutions, DigiWin WMS (sFLS) is designed specifically for manufacturing warehouses, handling raw materials, WIP inventory, and finished goods with production-linked workflows.

How is DigiWin WMS different from generic WMS solutions? + 

DigiWin WMS (sFLS) is built for manufacturing, not distribution. It includes production material kitting, shop floor delivery integration, WIP location tracking, and quality hold management — features that generic WMS solutions designed for e-commerce fulfillment simply don't offer. It also shares one database with DigiWin ERP and MES, eliminating integration complexity.

Can DigiWin WMS work with my existing ERP? + 

Yes. DigiWin WMS can operate standalone or integrate with any existing ERP system via standard APIs. It works natively with DigiWin ERP (T100/iGP) through a shared database, but also connects to SAP, Oracle, and other ERP platforms for inventory synchronization and order management.

What hardware do I need for DigiWin WMS? + 

DigiWin WMS works with standard Android or iOS mobile devices for barcode scanning, plus optional RFID readers for high-volume environments. You will need barcode label printers for location and item labeling. The system runs on standard server infrastructure or cloud deployment — no specialized hardware beyond mobile scanners is required.

How long does WMS implementation take? + 

A typical DigiWin WMS implementation takes 2–4 months, depending on warehouse complexity and the number of locations. Basic implementations with core receiving, putaway, and picking can go live in as little as 6 weeks. The phased approach lets you start with high-impact areas and expand coverage over time.
