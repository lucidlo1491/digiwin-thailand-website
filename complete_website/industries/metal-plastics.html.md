## Where Margins Are Made

In metal and plastics processing, **material costs are 50-70% of your total cost**. Every defective part is money in the scrap bin. Every second of cycle time drift is capacity you'll never recover. Small improvements in yield and efficiency **translate directly to the bottom line**—but you can't improve what you can't measure.

## The Process Manufacturing Challenge

Hidden losses that erode your margins

### Scrap Eats Margins

Material costs are your biggest expense. Every defective part is money thrown away. Small yield improvements create significant profit impact.

### Die/Mold Mysteries

Which die is causing defects? When does a mold need maintenance? Without data, you're guessing until it fails catastrophically.

### Cycle Time Drift

Machines slow down gradually. Operators don't notice 0.5 seconds per cycle—but over a shift, that's real capacity loss.

## How DigiWin Solves It

Data-driven visibility for process manufacturing

### Process Parameter Monitoring

Capture temperature, pressure, speed from every cycle. Correlate parameters to quality outcomes.

Real-time parameter capture 

Quality correlation analysis 

Out-of-spec alerts 

### Die/Mold Management

Track shot counts, maintenance history, and performance by tool. Predict maintenance needs before failures.

Shot count tracking 

Maintenance scheduling 

Tool performance trending 

### Scrap Analysis

Categorize defects by type, correlate to machine, shift, material lot. Find root causes, not just symptoms.

Defect categorization 

Pareto analysis 

Root cause correlation 

### Cycle Time Optimization

Real-time cycle time monitoring against standards. Alert on drift and identify bottlenecks.

Auto cycle detection 

Drift alerts 

OEE calculation 

### BOI Compliance

Production-order-level material reconciliation for BOI audits. Track actual material consumption per mold run — essential for co-product and multi-cavity tracking.

BOI-ready audit reports 

Co-product cost allocation 

Proven: 10M+ THB/yr saved 

## Why Metal & Plastics Manufacturing Needs Specialized ERP

7 production realities that generic ERP systems simply cannot handle

### Dual Unit Conversion

Track inventory in both KG (raw material) and PCS (finished parts) simultaneously — automatic conversion at every transaction.

### Heat Treatment Outsourcing

Manage external processing workflows where parts leave and return — full traceability through the outsourcing cycle.

### Furnace & Batch Tracking

Monitor furnace parameters (temperature, duration, atmosphere) tied to specific batches for quality certification.

### Die & Mold Management

Track die/mold lifecycle — usage counts, maintenance schedules, cost allocation across products.

### Container Quantity Control

Manage standard container quantities for efficient warehouse operations and accurate shipping.

### Multi-Process Routing

Handle complex routing where parts go through stamping, deburring, plating, and assembly with different cost centers.

### Scrap & Yield Management

Track material yield rates per operation, auto-calculate scrap costs, and feed back into BOM costing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

What ERP system is best for metal stamping factories in Thailand? + 

DigiWin offers ERP and MES solutions specifically designed for metal stamping and process manufacturing environments. The system includes real-time process parameter monitoring that captures temperature, pressure, and speed data from every cycle, then correlates those parameters directly to quality outcomes. For metal stamping factories where material costs represent 50-70% of total costs, this data-driven approach delivers an average 15% yield improvement and 30% reduction in unplanned downtime.

How does DigiWin help reduce scrap in injection molding? + 

DigiWin reduces injection molding scrap through real-time yield tracking combined with SPC integration. The system categorizes defects by type and correlates them to specific machines, shifts, and material lots using Pareto analysis and root cause correlation tools. Rather than discovering quality issues after the fact, operators receive out-of-spec alerts the moment process parameters drift, enabling immediate correction. This approach targets root causes rather than symptoms, turning small yield improvements into significant profit impact when material costs are your largest expense.

Can DigiWin track mold and die maintenance and shot counts? + 

Yes. DigiWin includes a built-in die and mold management module that tracks shot counts, complete maintenance history, and performance trending for every tool. The system predicts maintenance needs based on usage data, scheduling preventive maintenance before catastrophic failures occur. This eliminates the guesswork around questions like which die is causing defects and when a mold needs service, replacing reactive maintenance with data-driven tool performance management.

Does DigiWin support BOI compliance for metal and plastics manufacturers? + 

Yes. DigiWin provides production-order-level material reconciliation specifically designed for BOI audits in metal and plastics manufacturing. The system tracks actual material consumption per mold run, which is essential for co-product and multi-cavity tracking that BOI auditors require. Manufacturers using DigiWin for BOI compliance benefit from BOI-ready audit reports, accurate co-product cost allocation, and proven savings exceeding 10 million THB per year.

What process types does DigiWin support? + 

DigiWin supports a comprehensive range of metal and plastics processing methods including stamping, injection molding, die casting, CNC machining, forging, extrusion, sheet metal fabrication, and blow molding. Each process type benefits from DigiWin's core capabilities in cycle time optimization, process parameter monitoring, scrap analysis, and die/mold management. The system provides 100% cycle time visibility with auto cycle detection, drift alerts, and OEE calculation regardless of the specific manufacturing process.
