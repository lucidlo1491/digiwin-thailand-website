The Challenge 

## Seeing Is Believing — Screenshots Don't Replace Shop Floor Reality

Every software vendor shows polished demo screens. Carefully curated dashboards with perfect data, running on a demo server somewhere, operated by a sales engineer who knows exactly which buttons to click. It looks great in a meeting room. But what matters is how the system works on an actual production floor — with real machines, real operators, and real problems happening in real time.

The gap between a demo environment and a live factory is where most MES implementations fail. Operators who struggle with the interface. Data that doesn't flow because a sensor was misconfigured. Reports that look different when they're generated from actual production chaos instead of clean sample data. **You can't evaluate these things from a conference room.**

This factory visit gives you unfiltered access. Walk the production lines and see the screens operators actually use — not a curated demo. Ask workers directly about their experience with the system. Watch data flow live from CNC machines to the management dashboard and see how long it actually takes. This is the reality check that separates confident decisions from expensive guesses.

Visit Outcomes 

## What You'll Take Away from This Visit

### See a live MES implementation on a real production floor

Not a demo environment, not a simulation — a working factory with real production orders running through DigiWin MES right now.

### Observe how operators interact with the system during actual production

Watch real operators using MES terminals on the shop floor — see the interface they use, how they report production, and how they handle exceptions.

### Ask direct questions to factory staff about their experience

No sales filter. Talk directly to the plant manager, IT team, and line operators about what worked, what didn't, and what they'd change.

### Understand the practical requirements for your own MES deployment

Infrastructure, network, operator training, change management — learn what it actually takes from the people who've already done it.

Tour Agenda 

## A Structured Visit — Not a Sales Tour

Every stop is designed around what you need to evaluate — not what we want to showcase.

10:00 – 10:30 

### Arrival & Safety Briefing

Welcome, introductions, safety equipment distribution, and an overview of the factory's MES implementation journey.

10:30 – 11:30 

### Factory Floor Tour — Production Lines with Live MES

Walk the production lines and see DigiWin MES running on actual workstations. Watch operators report production, observe machine data collection, and see how exceptions are handled in real time.

11:30 – 12:00 

### Management Dashboard Room — Real-Time Data in Action

See how the data you just watched being collected on the shop floor appears on management dashboards — OEE, production progress, quality metrics, all updating live.

12:00 – 13:00 

### Networking Lunch with Factory Management

13:00 – 14:00 

### Q&A with Plant Manager & IT Team

Open session to ask anything — implementation timeline, challenges they faced, operator adoption, integration with existing systems, and the real costs involved.

14:00 – 14:45 

### Implementation Lessons Learned — What They'd Do Differently

The factory team shares their honest retrospective — what went well, what surprised them, and the advice they'd give to someone starting the same journey.

14:45 – 15:00 

### Wrap-Up & Next Steps

Summary of key takeaways, individual questions, and guidance on your next steps toward evaluating MES for your factory.

Who This Is For 

## Is This Visit Right for You?

Factory Owner / Managing Director 
Considering MES Investment 

You've seen the presentations and read the brochures, but you need to see MES working in a real factory before you commit budget. You want to understand what this investment actually looks like on the shop floor — not just on slides.

"I need to see this working in a real factory before I commit budget."

Operations / IT Manager 
Evaluating MES Solutions 

You'll be the one implementing and maintaining the system. You need to understand the practical reality — network requirements, operator training, integration complexity, and the day-to-day experience of running MES in production.

"I want to understand the practical reality of MES — not just the sales pitch."
