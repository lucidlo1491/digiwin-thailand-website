## Thailand's Electronics Ecosystem

Thailand exports **$40+ billion in electronics annually**, from hard disk drives to automotive electronics to consumer devices. Electronics manufacturers face unique complexity: **hundreds of unique parts per product**, constant changeovers for high-mix production, and moisture-sensitive components that require precise handling. DigiWin's MES was built specifically for this challenge.

## The Electronics Manufacturing Challenge

Complexity that generic systems can't handle

### Component Chaos

Hundreds of unique parts per product. Thousands of reels in inventory. One wrong component placed = entire batch scrap.

### Fast Changeovers

High-mix, low-volume means constant changeovers. Every minute of setup time is lost production capacity you can't recover.

### Moisture Sensitivity

MSD components that expire after floor exposure. Track it or scrap it. Manual tracking simply can't keep up with the pace.

## How DigiWin Solves It

Purpose-built capabilities for electronics assembly

### SMT Machine Integration

Direct connection to pick-and-place machines. Verify component reels before mounting. Prevent wrong-part defects at the source.

Wrong-part prevention 

Program download automation 

### Component-Level Traceability

Track every reel to every board position. Know exactly which components went into which products.

Reel to serial number linkage 

Full forward/backward trace 

Recall scope minimization 

### MSD Management

Automatic floor life tracking for moisture-sensitive components. System alerts before expiry to reduce scrap.

Auto floor life countdown 

Bake-out cycle tracking 

Expiry alerts & blocking 

### AOI/ICT Integration

Connect inspection results to MES. Track defect trends by component, machine, operator, and time.

Auto defect capture 

Pareto analysis 

SPC trending 

### BOI Compliance

Production-order-level material reconciliation for BOI audits. Track actual component consumption per assembly order — critical for bonded electronic components.

## Frequently Asked Questions

What MES system works best for electronics assembly in Thailand? + 

DigiWin MES is purpose-built for the complexity of electronics assembly, with native SMT machine integration that generic MES platforms cannot match. The system handles high-mix, low-volume production with thousands of unique component types, tracking every reel to every board position. It is deployed across Thailand's electronics ecosystem, which exports over $40 billion in electronics annually, from hard disk drives to automotive electronics.

Can DigiWin MES integrate with Fuji and Panasonic SMT machines? + 

Yes. DigiWin provides direct machine connectivity with all major SMT equipment brands including Fuji, Panasonic, Yamaha, Juki, and ASM pick-and-place machines, as well as AOI and ICT inspection systems from Koh Young, Omron, and Keysight. This integration enables reel verification at the feeder, wrong-part prevention, and automated program downloads, eliminating the manual data entry that causes costly component placement errors.

How does DigiWin handle moisture-sensitive component (MSD) tracking? + 

DigiWin automates the entire floor-life management process for moisture-sensitive devices. The system starts an automatic countdown the moment an MSD package is opened and exposed to floor conditions, tracks bake-out cycles for components that need reconditioning, and sends expiry alerts that block expired components from being used on the line. This automated approach has achieved a 45% reduction in MSD-related scrap compared to manual tracking methods.

Does DigiWin support BOI compliance for electronics factories? + 

Yes. DigiWin provides production-order-level material reconciliation specifically designed for BOI audits in electronics manufacturing. The system tracks actual component consumption per assembly order, which is critical for bonded electronic components that require precise import duty reconciliation. Electronics factories using DigiWin for BOI compliance have reported savings of over 10 million THB per year through accurate duty drawback claims and BOI-ready audit reports.

What pick accuracy can I achieve with DigiWin WMS? + 

DigiWin sFLS WMS delivers 99.9% pick accuracy for electronics warehouse operations. The system manages reel-level inventory with precise moisture-sensitive component handling, automated kitting support for production orders, and barcode-driven verification at every step. For electronics factories managing hundreds of unique parts per product and thousands of reels in inventory, this level of accuracy prevents the costly errors where one wrong component placed can result in an entire batch being scrapped.
