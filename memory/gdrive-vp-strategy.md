## Leadership Vision & 2026 Direction

### VP Pan Taihe (潘泰龢) - Corporate Strategy Keynote

**Company Vision:** "Smart Work, Enjoy Life" (智慧工作, 乐享生活)
**Company Mission:** Use data and intelligent technology to innovate productivity, creating digital workers that free employees' time for higher-value work.

**2030 Goal:** Become the Asia-Pacific's leading AI-native enterprise infrastructure provider.

**Five Pillars for 2030:**
1. **Product:** Digital Operating Space (数字运行空间) becomes the standard enterprise AI infrastructure
2. **Commercial:** Main business revenue transitions from selling software to selling AI agents; new revenue from space rental, AI Store subscriptions, digital-twin sales
3. **Ecosystem:** Gather ISV partners to develop AI agents on DigiWin's platform (Zhuge / 诸葛 platform)
4. **Employee:** AI-powered digital twins for every employee, reducing workload, increasing capability
5. **Organization:** Liquid organization (液态组织) - breaking departmental boundaries, task-based team assembly

**AI Agent (A-Gen) Development Progress:**
- From April to December 2025: developed 168 AI agents from zero
- ERP has 68 SOPs being reconstructed with AI agents
- Two types of agents: Action Agents (AA, executing automated flows) and Plan Agents (PA, expert judgment at decision nodes)
- Target: 80% of 68 ERP business loops reconstructed by end of 2026

**Revenue Model Transformation:**
- Current: 3 revenue streams (software sales, consulting, development) - "3 people earning 1 share"
- Future: Space rental fees, AI Store/CPA sales, personal digital twin sales, ecosystem revenue sharing, investment income
- 2028 target: 51/49 split between self-produced and ecosystem-generated revenue

**Key Innovation - Zhuge Platform (诸葛平台):**
- Multi-agent orchestration platform
- AI agent development environment (now using prompt engineering, not traditional coding)
- Agents developed on the platform seamlessly integrate with existing ERP/system APIs
- External ISV-developed agents can also be brought in via API calls
- "Commander" agent being trained to replace human orchestration of multiple agents

**Cockpit (座舱) Concept:**
- Digital workspace where employees interact with multiple AI agents
- 1.0 version already released - human-as-hub model interacting with specialized agents
- Future versions: Commander agent takes over orchestration, humans step back

### VP Zheng Jialin (鄭家麟) - Thailand Operations Direction

**2026 Thailand Strategic Priorities:**
1. Find and sign validated distributors by Q2 - ones that can actually bring customers
2. Sign end-customer deals and convert them to success stories
3. Build organizational capability to support both goals

**Channel Entry Strategies (Multiple Paths):**
- Path A: Financial/inventory-focused (avoid production management complexity initially)
- Path B: Target existing Odoo/SAP B1 resellers, offer MES/IoT as a wedge into production management, then gradually replace their ERP
- Path C: Target the gap between expensive SAP and cheaper alternatives (like Nexus model, Italy model - SAP upgrade too expensive, nothing viable below)
- Path D: Partner with accounting firms (especially Chinese-capital accounting firms in Thailand) who know local distributors
- Path E: Find SI companies in machine equipment, ISO management consulting

**Hiring Profile for Thailand:**
- Must have Thai + English language capability (Chinese is a bonus but not required)
- Comfortable presenting to groups (one-to-many seminars)
- Sales personality: proactive relationship builder, willing to do "dirty work" (cold outreach, handling rejection)
- Look at candidates from similar educational backgrounds as current team
- Consider recruiting from Odoo/SAP distributor salespeople or machine equipment SIs

**Market Approach:**
- Lock in industry focus, lock in geography, lock in themes
- Run serialized seminar campaigns under one umbrella theme (e.g., "How to improve Thai manufacturing competitiveness against Chinese imports")
- Example sub-themes: production transparency, inventory optimization, cash flow management, instant quoting, manufacturing cost analysis
- Target: 30-50 prospect names per month, work through them via calls, events, or site visits

## Channel Strategy (Partner Expansion)

### Distributor Model (from VP meetings)

**Key Insight - Margins in Competitor Ecosystems Are Low:**
- SAP/Odoo distributors get 2-5% license commission on deals sourced by the vendor
- Most leads come from vendor's SEO/marketing, not the distributor
- DigiWin can offer better economics because distributors would own the relationship

**Distributor Selection Criteria:**
- Must be able to generate customers independently (not just wait for leads)
- Industry knowledge preferred (manufacturing, machine equipment)
- Q2 2026 deadline for first signed distributor agreement
- Must show contribution within the year of signing

**Ecosystem Revenue Strategy (from Strategy Presentation):**
- Hardware partnerships: Google developed a custom chip for DigiWin's AI Server (cost reduced from NT$3-4M to ~NT$1M per unit)
- Qualcomm partnership: bundling AI applications (like invoice recognition, production assistant) with AI Server hardware
- ISV ecosystem: invite startups to develop AI agents on Zhuge platform; DigiWin provides customer base + platform + future integration path
- Two business models: (1) DigiWin commissions agent development from ISVs against a menu/blueprint, (2) ISVs bring their own agents to sell through DigiWin's channels

### Old Customer & VA Execution Plan (2026)

**Annual Target:** THB 40M (40,000K THB)
- January achievement: THB 1,789K (4.5% of annual target)
- Rhythm: "Low start, mid peak, stable end" (前低、中高、後穩)

**Three-Phase Customer Mining Strategy:**
1. **Phase 1 (Feb-Mar):** New/old customer handover meetings; initial audit of 109 existing customers; classify into A (large/budgeted), B (stable maintenance), C (zombie)
2. **Phase 2 (Q2):** "Trojan Horse" security health-check campaign - use cybersecurity assessment as entry point to audit full IT/ERP environment, produce diagnostic reports that become quotes
3. **Phase 3 (Q2+):** Convert findings - hardware refresh for aging servers, MES workshops for manufacturers, ETAX compliance for Thai companies

**Customer Matrix Approach:**
- Map all 109 customers against product gaps (has inventory but no accounting? has production but no MES?)
- Color-code: Red (urgent need), Yellow (potential need), Green (no current need)
- Three customer segments:
  - **Cash Cows:** Stable ERP users with old hardware -> push server refresh, cloud migration
  - **Stars:** Manufacturers with expansion plans -> push MES + machine connectivity bundles
  - **Long Tail:** Limited budget -> maintain contact via regulatory updates (ETAX), sell consumables

**Partnership Execution:**
- Q1: Co-host cybersecurity seminar with Digital Comm (targeting Taiwanese businesses)
- Q2: Co-host eMES Workshop with Digital Comm + WECON (targeting Thai businesses)
- INET partnership: cloud hosting + ETAX integration + seminar co-hosting
- Join Thailand IIOT Association to expand Thai market reach
- Ensure eMES Thai language version is corrected before Q2 workshop (critical for credibility)

## Solution Support Center

### Hong Zhiwen (洪之文) - Support Center 2025 Review & 2026 Plan

**2025 Achievements:**
- Business target achievement: 120%
- Gross margin target: 104%
- Accounts receivable collection rate: 92%
- Customer renewal rate: 95%
- 100% coverage of multi-topic customer engagement
- Delivery cycle improvement: 15% faster through tooling
- 4 certified consultants (senior and mid-level) in Thailand
- Multi-product capability: consultants now handle ERP, logistics, BPM, MES independently

**2025 Gaps Identified:**
- 70% of customers at project completion felt "no tangible benefit" - critical problem
- Outsourced training partners showed low engagement (sign in then disappear)
- AI application depth insufficient - customers interested but no commercial conversion

**2026 Three Strategic Goals:**

1. **AI Nativization (承接AI原生化)**
   - Build digital twins for three roles: consultant, customer service, SD
   - Start with knowledge Q&A capability
   - Connect to sales data pipeline (daily reports, contracts, service records)
   - Create a knowledge base that feeds back insights for both new and old customer management
   - Long-term: auto-generate project reports, onboarding reports, benefit assessments from accumulated consultation data

2. **Southeast Asia Policy Monetization**
   - Vietnam's Decree 99 (久久公报): requires IFRS alignment, internal controls, financial reporting standardization
   - Already received 50+ self-registered attendees for a single EDM announcement about compliance webinar
   - Use compliance as the "wedge" but frame AI as the future: "Compliance is the baseline, AI is the future"
   - Deploy security health-checks, factory transparency assessments
   - Sequence: compliance-driven urgrades -> AI capability -> ongoing subscription

3. **Ecosystem Team Building (承接生态结队)**
   - Develop practical training materials for distributors (not 6-month certification - faster path to revenue)
   - Certification mechanism on POP platform
   - Priority dispatch for certified distributor consultants

**Delivery Value Improvement Plan:**
- Front-load benefit definition: align expected outcomes with customer BEFORE implementation begins
- Each milestone report must reference the promised benefits
- Continuously remind the customer's team: "Your boss wants to see X metric by date Y"
- Final report: demonstrate achieved benefits vs. original promise

## Presale Materials (Plastics Industry Example)

### Eddie - Presale Demo Training for Plastics/Injection Molding

**Core Training Methodology:**
- Before visiting a plastics injection molding customer, the salesperson must research:
  1. **End product** - what does the customer actually manufacture?
  2. **Customer classification** - pure trading, assembly, or upstream component supplier?
  3. **Supply chain** - local procurement or international sourcing of raw materials?
  4. **Industry pain points** - what problems are typical for this specific sub-segment?
  5. **Relevant success cases** - do we have similar customer stories?

**Key Presale Principle:**
- The most critical skill for new salespeople is knowing how to communicate with consultants
- Understand the customer's industry characteristics BEFORE the demo
- Don't just memorize slides - learn to think from the customer's operational reality
- Different plastics sub-segments (injection molding, extrusion, blow molding) have different pain points and different DigiWin solution fits

**Sales-Consultant Coordination:**
- Salesperson gathers industry context and customer situation
- Communicates specific pain points to consultant
- Consultant prepares targeted demo addressing those exact issues
- This coordination is the differentiator between a good and bad presale experience

## Thai Tax & Compliance Features

### Yinhe (銀和) - T100 Thai Tax Package Technical Walkthrough

**Government Certification (Critical Differentiator):**
- DigiWin T100 has obtained Thai Revenue Department (税局) certification
- Took 2+ years and thousands of document submissions
- Only 2 foreign software companies have this certification (DigiWin + one Korean company)
- Competitors may claim tax compliance features but without this certification, their systems cannot legally generate tax filings

**Six Key Differences from Chinese T100:**

1. **Invoice Numbering (发票编码)**
   - Format: Company-specific prefix (字轨) + sequential number
   - Prefix can be up to 20 characters (no fixed length)
   - No mandatory rotation period (unlike Taiwan's bi-monthly rotation)
   - For group companies: each subsidiary gets a sequential branch number on invoices

2. **Debit Note (借记通知单)**
   - Unique to Thailand: allows issuing a supplementary invoice to add charges after the original sale
   - References the original invoice number
   - Flows through to accounts receivable like a regular invoice

3. **Invoice Printing (发票列印)**
   - Three distinct formats: Regular Invoice, Credit Note, Debit Note
   - Each has different required fields and layout
   - Typically printed on pre-printed forms; system fills in data

4. **Voucher/Journal Entry Printing (传票凭证)**
   - Date must convert to Buddhist Era (佛历年) - not Western calendar
   - Amount must display in Thai script (大写金额) - not Arabic numerals
   - Foreign currency vouchers: must additionally show currency type, exchange rate, and original currency amount

5. **VAT Filing Reports (进销项申报)**
   - Monthly detailed listing of all sales/purchase invoices
   - Must include full vendor/customer name, tax ID, branch number
   - Dates in Buddhist Era
   - Credit Note/Debit Note must reference original invoice
   - System generates Excel files in exact format required for upload to Thai Revenue Department portal

6. **Withholding Tax (代扣税) - Most Significant Difference**
   - Applies to: service purchases, agricultural products, certain special goods
   - KEY DIFFERENCE from China: In China, withholding tax is recognized when creating the AP (accounts payable); in Thailand, it's recognized only at payment time
   - Flow: AP created at full amount (e.g., 1000 THB) -> At payment, system automatically splits: 970 THB to vendor + 30 THB (3%) to tax authority as third-party AP
   - Partial payments: withholding tax calculated proportionally to amount paid
   - Bi-monthly filing: system generates summary + detail reports for tax authority submission
   - Nearly every customer encounters this (any miscellaneous expense triggers it)

**Language Support:**
- Full Thai UI interface (all field labels, menus, buttons)
- Thai-language reports
- Dual-language reports (Thai + Chinese) available for external/management reports
- UI is single-language only (switching between Thai/Chinese per user preference - no mixed display, as Thai text is too long for dual-display)

**Additional Credibility Points:**
- Operating in Thailand since 2019, ~100 clients served
- Includes pure Thai companies (not just Chinese overseas companies)
- Hold Thai software copyright
- E-invoicing: Thailand government preparing to launch; T100 will integrate with third-party e-invoice providers when available
- TFRS (Thai Financial Reporting Standards) closely aligned with IFRS - minimal accounting principle differences from China

## Customer Success & Recurring Revenue Model

### Customer Success Evolution Framework (Structured Article)

**Origin Story:**
- CS concept born at Salesforce circa 2000 - originally "churn prevention specialists"
- Fundamental shift: from "getting the system live" to "ensuring the customer succeeds because of our product"
- In the traditional software era, ERP was seen as a "surveillance tool"; CS reframed it as a "growth engine"

**Core Metrics for CS Organization:**
- **GRR (Gross Renewal Rate):** stability of base renewals
- **NRR (Net Renewal Rate):** net customer value growth (renewals + expansion - churn) - target 110%+
- **Churn Rate:** early warning of value erosion
- **Expansion Rate:** speed of success replication

**Three-Phase Customer Lifecycle:**
1. **Onboarding (30-60 days):** Achieve "First Success" - a quantifiable win that builds trust and sets the renewal foundation
2. **Retention:** Data-driven health management via Health Scores (login frequency, feature adoption); QBRs (Quarterly Business Reviews) for strategic alignment
3. **Expansion:** When customers see clear ROI, upselling becomes natural reinvestment, not a hard sell

**Three-Tier Service Model:**
1. **High-Touch (VIP):** Dedicated CSM for top-revenue/high-potential accounts; 1:1 service; regular QBRs; maximize NRR
2. **Scaled/Tech-Touch:** Automated emails, online tutorials, user communities, self-serve resources for mid/small accounts; maintain adoption without adding headcount
3. **CS Ops (Backend):** Health score systems, standardized QBR templates, data management; transforms CS from heroic individual effort to systematic machine

**Four Dimensions of Organizational DNA:**
1. **Language Standardization:** Align Sales and CS on shared definitions and metrics (NRR, success criteria)
2. **Rhythm Institutionalization:** Weekly cadences ("Monday review, Wednesday attack, Friday close-loop")
3. **Data Unification:** Single source of truth for renewal rates, health scores across all departments
4. **Learning Normalization:** Playbooks + Post-mortems for every win/loss

**Relevance to DigiWin Thailand Website:**
- The CS framework directly informs the "old customer" strategy and recurring revenue model
- Website messaging should reflect: "We don't just implement - we ensure your success"
- The onboarding -> retention -> expansion lifecycle maps to the customer journey messaging
- Health Score concept supports "proactive partnership" positioning vs. "reactive vendor"
