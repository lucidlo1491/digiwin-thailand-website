## The Revenue Model Pain

You know these patterns. We've heard them from every systems integrator we've talked to. The profit squeeze is structural, not circumstantial.

### The "Margin Erosion" Crisis

Your project margins have silently compressed from **35% to 18%** over the last few years. Clients demand Tier-1 capabilities (IoT, real-time costing) but refuse to pay more than Tier-3 prices.

### The "Unbillable Overrun"

You spend weeks fixing data errors or creating workarounds for rigid software (phantom BOMs, regrind logic) that you **cannot bill for**, turning profitable projects into break-even disasters.

### The "Ghost IT" Burden

You aren't just their ERP consultant — you've become their unpaid IT department. **Many Thai SMEs** lack a dedicated IT manager, so your senior staff wastes billable hours on Wi-Fi troubleshooting and password resets.

## The Operational Pain

Your best people are burning out. Not from hard work—from the wrong work.

### Consultant Burnout

Your senior consultants are quitting—not for salary, but because they're tired of being **"data babysitters."** They spend 50% of their time watching warehouse staff type numbers instead of doing solution architecture.

### The "Knowledge Ceiling"

You cannot scale beyond ~35 people because delivery relies on a few "hero" seniors. If one quits, it costs you **฿200,000 in recruitment plus 6 months** of lost productivity.

### The "Sales vs. Delivery" War

Sales promises "customized flexibility" to win deals. Delivery tries to force a rigid ERP to bend. This **perpetual conflict** drains morale and profit on every single project.

## "You Keep the Meat, We Drink the Soup"

Unlike global vendors who use partners as low-margin resellers, we deliberately give partners the high-margin revenue so you have a reason to grow with us.

Typical Vendor Model 

### Vendor Takes the Meat

- Vendor controls pricing and margin

- Partner is just a reseller channel

- Direct team competes for your deals

- Maintenance revenue goes to HQ

DigiWin Partner-First Model 

### Partner Keeps the Meat

- **100%** of implementation & service fees

- **30-40%** margin on license sales

- **Zero** channel conflict—Thai market is yours

- **Recurring** maintenance revenue—you set the rate

### Your Market, Not Ours

Our direct team handles Chinese/Taiwanese-owned factory inbound only. We don't compete for Thai SME deals because **your local relationships are the asset we can't replicate**.

### Deal Registration Protection

Once you book a lead, it is **locked to you for 6 months**. Our direct team or other partners cannot undercut your groundwork. It's in the Master Agreement.

### Land & Expand Strategy

Enter clients with lower-risk **MES or Workflow iGP** projects, then expand to full ERP once trust is established. Each phase generates revenue while deepening the relationship.

Why Now

## The Thai Market Window Is Open

Three converging forces are creating a rare opportunity for ERP partners in Thailand.

2027 

### Legacy ERP End-of-Life

Legacy enterprise ERP systems are reaching end of maintenance. Thai manufacturers on aging platforms must migrate — and the upgrade path from incumbent vendors is often prohibitively expensive for SMEs. This creates a migration window for manufacturing-focused alternatives.

~20 

### Competitors Scaling Fast

Chinese ERP vendors each now have ~20 staff in Thailand and growing. The window to establish market position is narrowing. Partners who move first lock in territory before competitors build their own channel networks.

8,000 

### Target Factories Identified

From Thailand's manufacturing base, we've identified 8,000 genuine targets. Only 113 are properly qualified so far — leaving 7,000+ untouched opportunities for partners to pursue.
