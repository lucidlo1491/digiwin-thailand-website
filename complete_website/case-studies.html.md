### The Challenge

Metal stamping manufacturer struggling with cost visibility and production tracking. Manual processes couldn't keep pace with growing order volumes. No real-time view of actual production costs vs. quoted costs.

### The Solution

Deployed DigiWin ERP for financial control and cost tracking, plus SFT (Shop Floor Tracking) for real-time production data collection. The combination gave management live visibility into actual costs at each production stage.

### The Challenge

PET plastic roll manufacturer with inventory accuracy problems and painfully slow month-end closing. Physical counts never matched system records. Finance team spent weeks reconciling.

### The Solution

> "Every scan updates the system instantly. We finally trust our inventory numbers." — Khun Ae, Warehouse

Recommended by a Fellow Manufacturer 

Thai Alpha chose DigiWin based on a recommendation from Thai Hosheng — a fellow manufacturer already running on our system. The strongest form of social proof is when a customer stakes their own reputation on your work.

Days to Close 

### The Challenge

Packaging manufacturer with the worst closing time in our case study portfolio — 90 days. Combined with low stock accuracy and unreliable on-time delivery. The business was growing but operations couldn't keep up.

### The Solution

Full DigiWin stack deployment: Workflow ERP for financials, WMS for warehouse accuracy, and SFT for shop floor tracking. Three systems working as one integrated operation.

### Why It Matters

Thai Hosheng is the most comprehensive deployment in our case study portfolio — ERP + WMS + SFT together. The 90-to-15-day closing improvement is the most dramatic transformation. They also referred Thai Alpha to DigiWin, proving satisfaction strong enough to stake their own reputation on.

Manufacturing

## MUFU Technologies

Manufacturing technology · Taiwan

Workflow ERP (iGP) 

Full Automation 

### The Challenge

Manufacturing company with manual, disconnected processes across departments. Information silos meant no single view of operations. Each department had its own spreadsheets, its own version of the truth.

### The Solution

Deployed DigiWin Workflow ERP to unify all departments — purchasing, production, inventory, and finance — into a single system. One source of truth, one workflow, one set of numbers.

### Results

- Full automation of cross-department workflows

- Eliminated manual data re-entry between departments

- Single source of truth for all operational data

Fasteners

## Taiyo Fastener Thailand

Japanese-standard fastener manufacturer · Bangpoo Industrial Estate, Samut Prakan

Subsidiary of Taiyoseiko Corporation, Japan

ERP 
WMS (sFLS) 

Systems Unified 

### The Challenge

Japanese fastener manufacturer operating in Thailand with multiple disconnected systems. Material tracking errors caused production delays and customer delivery issues.

### The Solution

Deployed DigiWin ERP and WMS to replace fragmented systems with a single unified platform. Barcode-driven warehouse operations eliminated manual material tracking.

### Results

- Unified multiple legacy systems into one platform

- Reduced material tracking errors

- Improved production scheduling accuracy

Japanese Quality Standards, Thai Operations 

When a Japanese manufacturer with the world's strictest quality standards chose DigiWin for their Thailand operation, it wasn't because we were the cheapest option. Taiyo Fastener (a subsidiary of Japan's Taiyoseiko Corporation) needed a system that could meet Japanese-grade traceability and accuracy requirements — in a Thai manufacturing environment.
