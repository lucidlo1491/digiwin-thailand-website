## 1. How to Use This Document

This Playbook is the **how** of persuasion. The PRD (Layer 1) defines what pages exist and why. This document defines how to write them.

When generating a Content Spec (Layer 3) for any page, Claude should:
1. Identify the **audience track** (A: Factory Owners & Operators or B: Distributor Prospects)
2. Identify the **buyer journey stage** (Awareness â†’ Consideration â†’ Evaluation â†’ Decision)
3. Select the appropriate **voice register** from Section 2
4. Apply the relevant **objection-handling scripts** from Section 4
5. Format proof elements according to Section 5
6. Use CTA language from Section 6

---

## 2. Voice & Tone Calibration

DigiWin's voice is consistent across the site: **expert, confident, manufacturing-specific.** But the tone â€” the emotional temperature â€” shifts depending on who's reading and what they need to feel.

### 2.1 Universal Voice Rules

These apply to ALL pages, both audiences:

**Always:**
- Ground claims in specifics: "44 years," "50,000+ clients," "100+ Thai implementations" â€” never "many years of experience" or "thousands of customers"
- Use manufacturing language: "shop floor," "OEE," "BOM," "production scheduling" â€” not "business processes" or "workflow optimization"
- Write in active voice: "DigiWin tracks every unit" not "Every unit is tracked by the system"
- Keep sentences under 20 words in hero sections, under 25 words in body copy
- One idea per paragraph in body copy

**Never:**
- Use "solution" as a standalone noun without specifying what it solves
- Say "cutting-edge," "best-in-class," "world-class," or "leverage" â€” these are empty
- Use "we understand your challenges" â€” show understanding by naming the specific challenge
- Describe DigiWin as "a leading ERP provider" â€” say what makes it specific: "the manufacturing ERP specialist"
- Promise anything that requires HQ pricing approval

### 2.2 Track A â€” Factory Owners & Operators

**Who they are:** This track serves two layers of the same audience. At the top: **Thai manufacturing company owners and managing directors** â€” the people who sign checks, set strategy, and worry about competitiveness, margins, and growth. Below them: **production managers, plant managers, CFOs, and IT directors** â€” the people who run daily operations and evaluate software. Both layers exist at Thai-owned manufacturing SMEs (20-500 employees). Many have been burned by failed ERP implementations or are drowning in Excel spreadsheets. They're skeptical of software vendors who don't understand manufacturing.

**Owner-level concerns:** Business competitiveness, export readiness, cost control across the operation, keeping up with larger competitors who already have ERP, succession planning (systematizing the business so it doesn't depend on one person's memory).

**Operator-level concerns:** Daily production visibility, inventory accuracy, scheduling reliability, compliance reporting, reducing manual data entry.

**Emotional baseline:** Owners are strategic but risk-averse â€” they've built something and don't want a bad software decision to damage it. Operators are practical and time-poor â€” they respect expertise and distrust marketing polish. Both respond to concrete proof over promises.

| Journey Stage | Tone | Register | Example |
|---------------|------|----------|---------|
| Awareness | Empathetic + direct | "We know what you're dealing with" | "Your production manager shouldn't need 3 spreadsheets to answer a simple question about today's output." |
| Consideration | Confident + specific | "Here's exactly what changes" | "Real-time OEE tracking means you see machine utilization as it happens â€” not in last week's report." |
| Evaluation | Reassuring + evidence-based | "Others like you made this work" | "A 200-employee automotive parts manufacturer in Rayong reduced ghost inventory by 34% within 6 months of sFLS deployment." |
| Decision | Calm + action-oriented | "Here's your next step" | "Request a free factory assessment. We'll show you exactly where DigiWin fits in your operation â€” no obligation." |

**Track A vocabulary preferences:**
- "Factory" over "enterprise" or "organization"
- "Your business" (for owners) and "your production line" (for operators) â€” match the reader's level
- "See your data" over "gain visibility"
- "Your team" over "end users"
- "Works with your existing systems" over "seamless integration"
- "Grow confidently" and "compete with the big players" â€” owner-level aspirational language
- "Systematize" over "digitize" â€” owners want to reduce dependence on tribal knowledge

### 2.3 Track B â€” Distributor Prospects

**Who they are:** Owners and managing directors of ERP implementation firms, accounting practices expanding into advisory, and IT consultancies seeking a manufacturing vertical. They run businesses of 10-50 people. They're commercially savvy, understand margins, and are tired of the man-day grind.

**Emotional baseline:** Entrepreneurial, margin-conscious, skeptical of vendor promises. They've heard "partner program" pitches before. They respect straight talk about money.

| Journey Stage | Tone | Register | Example |
|---------------|------|----------|---------|
| Awareness | Provocative + truthful | "Let's name what's broken" | "You're billing 200 man-days a year per consultant. Your revenue has a ceiling. Your best people are exhausted. There's a different model." |
| Consideration | Strategic + opportunity-focused | "Here's what smart operators are doing" | "The top-performing DigiWin partners don't sell implementations. They sell manufacturing outcomes â€” and collect recurring revenue while they sleep." |
| Evaluation | Transparent + numbers-driven | "Here are the actual economics" | "Year 1: 3 iGP implementations at à¸¿X margin. Year 2: renewals kick in plus 2 MES upsells. Year 3: your recurring base covers fixed costs." |
| Decision | Direct + protective | "We'll protect your investment" | "Territory protection. Zero channel conflict. Pre-sales engineering support. Your clients stay your clients." |

**Track B vocabulary preferences:**
- "Your business" over "your company"
- "Revenue" and "margin" over "profit" (sounds more strategic)
- "Portfolio" over "product line" (they're curating an offering)
- "Your clients" over "end users" or "customers"
- "Recurring revenue" over "subscription income"
- "Growth path" over "scalability"

## 3. Emotional Arc Templates

Each page follows an emotional arc â€” a deliberate sequence of feelings the visitor should experience from top to bottom. These templates ensure pages don't just inform but *move* the reader toward action.

### 3.1 Hub Page Arc (Home, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0)

Hub pages route traffic. Their arc is: **Recognition â†’ Curiosity â†’ Self-Selection.**

```
TOP:    "That's me" (visitor recognizes their situation)
MIDDLE: "Tell me more" (visitor sees a path that's relevant)
BOTTOM: "I'll go here" (visitor clicks to the right leaf page)
```

- Hero: Name the situation (pain or aspiration) â€” visitor nods in recognition
- Body: Present 2-4 clear paths with enough detail to choose
- CTA: Bridge CTAs that lead deeper, not "Contact Us" yet

### 3.2 Leaf Page Arc â€” Track A (Product pages, Industry pages)

Leaf pages convert factory owners and operators. Their arc is: **Pain â†’ Solution â†’ Proof â†’ Action.**

```
TOP:    "Yes, that's my problem" (pain naming)
MIDDLE: "This could actually work" (capability + proof)
BOTTOM: "I should talk to them" (confidence to act)
```

- Hero: Name the specific manufacturing pain (not generic business pain)
- Capabilities: Frame as Problem â†’ Solution pairs, never feature lists
- Proof: Case study with measurable outcome from a similar factory
- CTA: Low-commitment first step ("See a demo," "Request assessment")

### 3.3 Leaf Page Arc â€” Track B (Partner pages 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)

Leaf pages convert distributor prospects. Their arc is: **Disruption â†’ Possibility â†’ Economics â†’ Safety.**

```
TOP:    "They understand my problem" (pain validated)
MIDDLE: "This model could change my business" (alternative presented)
BOTTOM: "And they'll make sure I succeed" (risk removed)
```

- Hero: Provocative truth about their current model
- Body: The alternative model with enough specificity to be credible
- Economics: Revenue scenarios, margin comparisons, concrete numbers
- Protection: Guarantees that remove the risk of switching
- CTA: High-value exchange ("Discovery call," "Download economics brief")

### 3.4 Partner Product Page Arc (2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3)

These pages are unique: the product is framed through the lens of *what you can sell*, not *what it does*.

```
TOP:    "Here's a gap in your portfolio" (market positioning)
MIDDLE: "Here's what you'll sell and to whom" (capabilities, partner-framed)
BOTTOM: "Here's the revenue opportunity" (deal size, margin, timeline)
```

- Hero: Competitive positioning (e.g., "Enterprise ERP Without the Enterprise Price Tag")
- Capabilities: Written for the partner, not the end user â€” what the partner needs to know to sell it
- Opportunity: Specific â€” target segment, average deal size range, implementation timeline
- CTA: "Add this to your portfolio" tone, not "buy this product"

### 3.5 Economics Page Arc (2.3)

This page must feel like opening a spreadsheet, not reading a brochure.

```
TOP:    "Let's talk numbers" (signal: this page is concrete)
MIDDLE: "Here's how the math works" (revenue model, margin comparison)
LOWER:  "Here's how you're protected" (guarantees, territory, support)
BOTTOM: "Here's your growth path" (4-stage maturity) + CTA
```

- Every claim must have a number or a scenario attached
- Ranges are acceptable (and preferred over exact figures that require HQ approval)
- The 4-stage maturity path addresses "but how do I get from here to there?"
- End with both a high-touch CTA (discovery call) and a self-serve CTA (download brief)

## 4. Objection-Handling Scripts

Every fear from the PRD's Fear Inventory (Section 2.3) is mapped here with a reusable neutralization pattern: **Name it â†’ Reframe it â†’ Prove it.**

The rule: objection handling is woven into page copy â€” never in a standalone "FAQ" section. When a visitor encounters the answer to their unspoken fear naturally within the narrative, it feels like the company "just gets it."

### 4.1 Factory Owner & Operator Objections

**Objection 1: "Implementation will disrupt production"**

- **Where:** 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 (product pages), 4.x (industry pages)
- **Name it:** "The #1 fear isn't cost â€” it's downtime."
- **Reframe:** "DigiWin implementations run in parallel. Your production never stops. Our phased approach means we go live module by module, not big-bang."
- **Prove it:** Implementation timeline visual showing parallel run. Case study metric: "Deployed across 3 lines in 12 weeks while maintaining 98% on-time delivery."

**Objection 2: "We tried ERP before and it failed"**

- **Where:** 1.0 (Home), 3.0 (Products Hub), 4.x (Industry pages)
- **Name it:** "If your last ERP failed, it probably wasn't built for manufacturing."
- **Reframe:** "Generic ERPs treat a factory like an office. Manufacturing ERP speaks BOMs, routings, work orders, and OEE â€” natively."
- **Prove it:** Case study from a factory that replaced a failed generic ERP with DigiWin. Before/after metrics.

**Objection 3: "We'll be locked into a vendor"**

- **Where:** 3.0 (Products Hub), Home Section 5 (DigiWin Difference)
- **Name it:** "Your ERP should grow with you, not hold you hostage."
- **Reframe:** "DigiWin's product ladder â€” iGP â†’ T100 â†’ MES â†’ WMS â†’ AIoT â€” means you upgrade within the ecosystem. Your investment compounds, never resets."
- **Prove it:** Growth path diagram. Case study of a company that started with iGP and scaled.

**Objection 4: "My team can't learn a new system"**

- **Where:** 3.x (product pages), 5.2 (About Us â€” Section 7)
- **Name it:** "A system your team won't use is worse than no system at all."
- **Reframe:** "50+ Thai staff. 60%+ bilingual. Training in Thai, support in Thai. Your operators learn on their terms."
- **Prove it:** Thai-language UI screenshots. Training program details. Team composition stats.

**Objection 5: "It's too expensive for our size"**

- **Where:** 3.1 (ERP Core â€” iGP section), Home Section 3 (Value Props)
- **Name it:** "Enterprise pricing doesn't belong in an SME factory."
- **Reframe:** "iGP is purpose-built for 20-200 employee factories. Not enterprise software scaled down â€” SME software built up."
- **Prove it:** ROI scenario: "Typical iGP client sees ROI within 12 months through reduced inventory waste and improved scheduling accuracy." No exact pricing (requires HQ).

### 4.2 Distributor Prospect Objections

**Objection 1: "DigiWin will compete with me for clients"**

- **Where:** 2.0 (Partner Hub), 2.3 (Partner Economics)
- **Name it:** "The #1 reason partner programs fail: the vendor becomes your competitor."
- **Reframe:** "DigiWin's direct team serves Taiwanese/Chinese companies. The Thai local market is partner-only. By structure, not by promise."
- **Prove it:** Explicit guarantee. Structural explanation of market segmentation. "Zero channel conflict" as a headline, not a footnote.

**Objection 2: "The product is too complex for my team"**

- **Where:** 2.2 (Solution Stack), 2.3 (Partner Economics)
- **Name it:** "You don't need to be a DigiWin expert on Day 1."
- **Reframe:** "Our 4-stage maturity path starts with co-implementation. DigiWin engineers work alongside your team."
- **Prove it:** The 4 stages with timelines:
  1. **Filter** (Month 1-2): DigiWin qualifies leads, partner observes
  2. **Empower** (Month 3-6): DigiWin leads implementation, partner supports
  3. **Pilot** (Month 6-12): Partner leads, DigiWin supports
  4. **Independent** (Year 2+): Partner delivers fully, DigiWin provides product support

**Objection 3: "My clients won't switch from SAP/Oracle"**

- **Where:** 2.2.3 (AIoT & MES), 2.2 (Solution Stack)
- **Name it:** "Nobody's asking them to rip and replace."
- **Reframe:** "The reverse cut: enter through MES alongside existing ERP, prove shop floor ROI, expand into ERP when the client is ready."
- **Prove it:** Reverse cut diagram. MES as non-threatening entry point â†’ data dependency â†’ full ERP migration.

**Objection 4: "The margins won't be better"**

- **Where:** 2.3 (Partner Economics â€” core content), 2.1 (Business Model Crisis)
- **Name it:** "If the math doesn't work, nothing else matters."
- **Reframe:** "Three revenue streams: implementation (project fees), license (one-time or recurring), maintenance (annual annuity). Man-day revenue is linear. Product-led revenue compounds."
- **Prove it:** Year 1-2-3 scenario table. Margin comparison vs. current model. Emphasis on compounding recurring revenue.

**Objection 5: "They won't understand the Thai market"**

- **Where:** 2.0 (Partner Hub), 5.2 (About Us)
- **Name it:** "Fair question."
- **Reframe:** "8 years in Thailand. 50+ Thai staff. 60%+ bilingual. 100+ implementations. Thai-registered company with Thai majority ownership. We don't need to understand the Thai market â€” we're in it."
- **Prove it:** Stats banner. Team photo. Bangkok office. Thai client logos.

## 5. Proof Formatting Guidelines

### 5.1 Proof Escalation by Page Depth

| Page Type | Proof Level | What to Use |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Hub pages (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0) | Light | Stats + logo bar + capability claims |
| Mid-funnel leaves (2.1, 2.2, 3.x) | Medium | Problemâ†’Solution pairs + case study snippets |
| Conversion leaves (2.3, 4.x, 5.1) | Heavy | Full case studies + testimonials + ROI scenarios + guarantees |

### 5.2 Stats Formatting

- Use the actual number: "44 years" not "over 40 years"
- Large numbers get comma separators: "50,000+"
- Every number gets a context label: "50,000+ Manufacturing Clients Worldwide"
- "+" suffix signals ongoing growth
- Stock code 300378 always presented as trust signal
- Stats banners: dark background (#253B50), white text, large font, counter animation

### 5.3 Case Study Structure

```
[Company Industry] manufacturer in [Location]

Challenge: [1-2 sentences â€” the specific manufacturing problem]
Solution: [1-2 sentences â€” which DigiWin products were deployed]
Results:  [2-3 measurable metrics with before â†’ after]
Timeline: [Implementation duration]
```

Rules:
- Minimum 2 measurable metrics
- Always include implementation timeline
- Industry must match the page it appears on
- If no real case study available: use composite scenario clearly labeled "representative example based on typical DigiWin implementations"

### 5.4 Testimonial Structure

```
"[1-2 sentence quote â€” specific outcome, never generic praise]"
â€” [Full Name], [Title], [Company]
```

Rules:
- If no real testimonials available yet: use stat-based proof as placeholder
- Never fabricate quotes
- Place near CTAs â€” testimonials reduce friction at the decision moment

## 6. CTA Language & Hierarchy

### 6.1 Commitment Ladder

| Level | CTA Type | Track A Examples | Track B Examples |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 (Browse) | Bridge | "See Our Solutions" | "Explore the Partner Model" |
| 2 (Self-Serve) | Download | "Download Product Guide" | "Download Partner Economics Brief" |
| 3 (Low-Touch) | Assessment | "Request a Free Assessment" | "See the Revenue Calculator" |
| 4 (High-Touch) | Conversation | "Talk to Our Team" | "Schedule a Discovery Call" |
| 5 (Conversion) | Action | "Request a Demo" | "Become a Partner" |

### 6.2 CTA Rules

- Every page ends with exactly one primary CTA
- Bridge CTAs appear mid-page to move visitors to the next page in sequence
- Never use "Submit" â€” always action language: "Send My Request," "Get My Assessment"
- Track A CTAs emphasize low risk: "free," "no obligation," "see for yourself"
- Track B CTAs emphasize exclusivity: "discovery call" (not sales call), "explore the partnership"
- Shared pages (Home, About Us): always show dual CTAs â€” "Request a Demo" + "Become a Partner"

### 6.3 CTA Visual Standards

- Primary: #3798E4 background, white text, rounded corners
- Secondary: white background, #3798E4 border and text (ghost button)
- CTA banner sections: #253B50 or #F5F7FA background, full-width
- Button text: 16-18px, bold, sentence case
- Mobile: full-width buttons, minimum 48px tap target

## 7. Page-Specific Copywriting Notes

### 7.1 Home (1.0) â€” The 5-Second Rule

- Hero copy: 5-7 words per panel maximum
- No jargon â€” a factory manager and a consulting firm owner must both instantly self-identify
- Split-screen visual does the heavy lifting; copy supports
- Below hero, content serves both audiences until Industry Selector (Track A only)

### 7.2 Partner Program Hub (2.0) â€” Highest Persuasion Load

- Headline must create cognitive dissonance: "Stop Selling Man-Days" challenges identity
- Pain Point Trio uses distributor's own internal language
- Product growth ladder visual is the single most important image on the site
- Social proof: stock code + client count matter more than individual logos for this audience

### 7.3 Business Model Crisis (2.1) â€” Empathy First

- "We've seen this pattern" not "you're doing it wrong"
- Side-by-side comparison should feel like discovery, not accusation
- End with possibility: "See how the math changes" â€” invitation, not push

### 7.4 Partner Economics (2.3) â€” Spreadsheet Energy

- Feels like opening a spreadsheet, not reading a brochure
- Ranges over exact figures (HQ pricing approval required for specifics)
- Year 1-2-3 scenarios: conservative and credible â€” overpromising kills trust here
- 4-stage maturity path includes concrete deliverables at each stage, not abstract "support"

### 7.5 Industry Pages (4.1-4.3) â€” Speak Their Dialect

- **Automotive:** JIT, EDI, mold lifecycle, customer portal â€” table-stakes terms
- **Electronics:** SMT, component traceability, yield calculation, RoHS â€” if these are missing, trust is gone
- **Metal & Plastics:** Dual-unit (kgâ†’PCS), scrap tracking, material yield, die management â€” think materials and waste

### 7.6 About Us (5.2) â€” The Due Diligence Page

- Timeline (1982-present) builds trust through longevity
- Stats banner: most visually impactful element â€” large numbers, dark background, counter animation
- "Because of DigiWin" section pivots from company story to visitor benefit
- Thailand story (Section 7) directly addresses "will they understand Thai market?" â€” must feel authentic

## 8. Content Formulas

Reusable structures for Content Specs.

### 8.1 Hero Formula

```
[Headline: 5-10 words, bold, active]
[Subhead: 15-20 words, expands on headline]
[CTA: 3-5 words, action-oriented]
```

### 8.2 Pain-Point Card Formula

```
[Pain name: 2-4 words, bold]
[One sentence: the pain in visitor's language]
[One sentence: hint at the alternative]
```

### 8.3 Problem â†’ Solution Pair Formula

```
[Problem: one sentence starting with observable pain]
â†’
[Solution: one sentence starting with DigiWin capability + outcome]
```

### 8.4 Case Study Snippet Formula

```
[Industry] manufacturer in [Location] â€” [Key metric] within [Timeframe]
```

### 8.5 Bridge CTA Formula

```
[Action verb] + [what they'll see/get] â†’ links to [specific page]
```

---

## 9. Translation & Localization Notes

### 9.1 Principles

- Translate meaning, not words â€” Thai business register is less direct than English
- Manufacturing terms often stay in English on Thai factory floors: OEE, BOM, MRP, MES, FIFO, JIT, EDI
- Formal register (à¸„à¸£à¸±à¸š/à¸„à¹ˆà¸°) in CTAs and forms
- Product names stay in English: T100, iGP, sMES, SFT, sFLS
- "DigiWin" stays in English; é¼Žæ–° in parentheses for Chinese-reading audiences

### 9.2 Key Headlines to Transcreate (Not Just Translate)

These headlines rely on English rhythm and should be culturally adapted for Thai:
- "Stop Selling Man-Days. Start Selling Manufacturing Outcomes."
- "Stop Guessing. Start Seeing."
- "Every Item. Every Location. Every Time."
- "The Man-Day Trap"

Flag these in Content Specs when they appear.

## 10. Anti-Patterns

What DigiWin copy must never do:

1. **Sound generic.** If "SAP" could replace "DigiWin" and the sentence still works â€” rewrite it.
2. **Lead with features.** Always outcomes first. "See all factories in one dashboard" not "multi-entity consolidated financials module."
3. **Name competitors.** "Unlike generalist ERPs" not "unlike SAP." Let the reader fill in the name.
4. **Use fear on factory owners or operators.** Empathize, then solve. "You're not alone" not "you're losing money."
5. **Make unsubstantiated claims.** Every claim needs a number, a case study, or a structural truth.
6. **Shout.** Maximum 3 exclamation marks across the entire 20-page site.
7. **Write walls of text.** Max 3 sentences per paragraph. Manufacturing buyers scan.
8. **Frame the Partner Program as distribution.** It's a business transformation opportunity â€” about their growth, not our reach.
