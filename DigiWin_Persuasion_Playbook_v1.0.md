# DigiWin Thailand â€” Persuasion Playbook

**Layer 2 Document**
**Version:** 1.3
**Last Updated:** February 11, 2026
**Purpose:** Voice guide, copywriting patterns, and objection-handling scripts for all website content
**Audience:** Claude (reference when generating Content Specs)

## 1. How to Use This Document

This Playbook is the **how** of persuasion. The PRD (Layer 1) defines what pages exist and why. This document defines how to write them.

When generating a Content Spec (Layer 3) for any page, Claude should:
1. Identify the **audience track** (A: Factory Owners & Operators or B: Distributor Prospects)
2. Identify the **buyer journey stage** (Awareness â†’ Consideration â†’ Evaluation â†’ Decision)
3. Select the appropriate **voice register** from Section 2
4. Apply the relevant **objection-handling scripts** from Section 4
5. Format proof elements according to Section 5
6. Use CTA language from Section 6

## 2. Voice & Tone Calibration

DigiWin's voice is consistent across the site: **expert, confident, manufacturing-specific.** But the tone â€” the emotional temperature â€” shifts depending on who's reading and what they need to feel.

### 2.1 Universal Voice Rules

These apply to ALL pages, both audiences:

**Always:**
- Ground claims in specifics: "44 years," "50,000+ clients," "100+ Thai implementations" â€” never "many years of experience" or "thousands of customers"
- Use manufacturing language: "shop floor," "OEE," "BOM," "production scheduling" â€” not "business processes" or "workflow optimization"
- Write in active voice: "DigiWin tracks every unit" not "Every unit is tracked by the system"
- Keep sentences under 20 words in hero sections, under 25 words in body copy
- One idea per paragraph in body copy

**Never:**
- Use "solution" as a standalone noun without specifying what it solves
- Say "cutting-edge," "best-in-class," "world-class," or "leverage" â€” these are empty
- Use "we understand your challenges" â€” show understanding by naming the specific challenge
- Describe DigiWin as "a leading ERP provider" â€” say what makes it specific: "the manufacturing ERP specialist"
- Promise anything that requires HQ pricing approval

### 2.2 Track A â€” Factory Owners & Operators

**Who they are:** This track serves two layers of the same audience. At the top: **Thai manufacturing company owners and managing directors** â€” the people who sign checks, set strategy, and worry about competitiveness, margins, and growth. Below them: **production managers, plant managers, CFOs, and IT directors** â€” the people who run daily operations and evaluate software. Both layers exist at Thai-owned manufacturing SMEs (20-500 employees). Many have been burned by failed ERP implementations or are drowning in Excel spreadsheets. They're skeptical of software vendors who don't understand manufacturing.

**Owner-level concerns:** Business competitiveness, export readiness, cost control across the operation, keeping up with larger competitors who already have ERP, succession planning (systematizing the business so it doesn't depend on one person's memory).

**Operator-level concerns:** Daily production visibility, inventory accuracy, scheduling reliability, compliance reporting, reducing manual data entry.

**Emotional baseline:** Owners are strategic but risk-averse â€” they've built something and don't want a bad software decision to damage it. Operators are practical and time-poor â€” they respect expertise and distrust marketing polish. Both respond to concrete proof over promises.

| Journey Stage | Tone | Register | Example |
|---------------|------|----------|---------|
| Awareness | Empathetic + direct | "We know what you're dealing with" | "Your production manager shouldn't need 3 spreadsheets to answer a simple question about today's output." |
| Consideration | Confident + specific | "Here's exactly what changes" | "Real-time OEE tracking means you see machine utilization as it happens â€” not in last week's report." |
| Evaluation | Reassuring + evidence-based | "Others like you made this work" | "A 200-employee automotive parts manufacturer in Rayong reduced ghost inventory by 34% within 6 months of sFLS deployment." |
| Decision | Calm + action-oriented | "Here's your next step" | "Request a free factory assessment. We'll show you exactly where DigiWin fits in your operation â€” no obligation." |

**Track A vocabulary preferences:**
- "Factory" over "enterprise" or "organization"
- "Your business" (for owners) and "your production line" (for operators) â€” match the reader's level
- "See your data" over "gain visibility"
- "Your team" over "end users"
- "Works with your existing systems" over "seamless integration"
- "Grow confidently" and "compete with the big players" â€” owner-level aspirational language
- "Systematize" over "digitize" â€” owners want to reduce dependence on tribal knowledge

### 2.3 Track B â€” Distributor Prospects

**Who they are:** Owners and managing directors of ERP implementation firms, accounting practices expanding into advisory, and IT consultancies seeking a manufacturing vertical. They run businesses of 10-50 people. They're commercially savvy, understand margins, and are tired of the man-day grind.

**Emotional baseline:** Entrepreneurial, margin-conscious, skeptical of vendor promises. They've heard "partner program" pitches before. They respect straight talk about money.

| Journey Stage | Tone | Register | Example |
|---------------|------|----------|---------|
| Awareness | Provocative + truthful | "Let's name what's broken" | "You're billing 200 man-days a year per consultant. Your revenue has a ceiling. Your best people are exhausted. There's a different model." |
| Consideration | Strategic + opportunity-focused | "Here's what smart operators are doing" | "The top-performing DigiWin partners don't sell implementations. They sell manufacturing outcomes â€” and collect recurring revenue while they sleep." |
| Evaluation | Transparent + numbers-driven | "Here are the actual economics" | "Year 1: 3 iGP implementations at à¸¿X margin. Year 2: renewals kick in plus 2 MES upsells. Year 3: your recurring base covers fixed costs." |
| Decision | Direct + protective | "We'll protect your investment" | "Territory protection. Zero channel conflict. Pre-sales engineering support. Your clients stay your clients." |

**Track B vocabulary preferences:**
- "Your business" over "your company"
- "Revenue" and "margin" over "profit" (sounds more strategic)
- "Portfolio" over "product line" (they're curating an offering)
- "Your clients" over "end users" or "customers"
- "Recurring revenue" over "subscription income"
- "Growth path" over "scalability"

## 3. Emotional Arc Templates

Each page follows an emotional arc â€” a deliberate sequence of feelings the visitor should experience from top to bottom. These templates ensure pages don't just inform but *move* the reader toward action.

### 3.1 Hub Page Arc (Home, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0)

Hub pages route traffic. Their arc is: **Recognition â†’ Curiosity â†’ Self-Selection.**

```
TOP:    "That's me" (visitor recognizes their situation)
MIDDLE: "Tell me more" (visitor sees a path that's relevant)
BOTTOM: "I'll go here" (visitor clicks to the right leaf page)
```

- Hero: Name the situation (pain or aspiration) â€” visitor nods in recognition
- Body: Present 2-4 clear paths with enough detail to choose
- CTA: Bridge CTAs that lead deeper, not "Contact Us" yet

### 3.2 Leaf Page Arc â€” Track A (Product pages, Industry pages)

Leaf pages convert factory owners and operators. Their arc is: **Pain â†’ Solution â†’ Proof â†’ Action.**

```
TOP:    "Yes, that's my problem" (pain naming)
MIDDLE: "This could actually work" (capability + proof)
BOTTOM: "I should talk to them" (confidence to act)
```

- Hero: Name the specific manufacturing pain (not generic business pain)
- Capabilities: Frame as Problem â†’ Solution pairs, never feature lists
- Proof: Case study with measurable outcome from a similar factory
- CTA: Low-commitment first step ("See a demo," "Request assessment")

### 3.3 Leaf Page Arc â€” Track B (Partner pages 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)

Leaf pages convert distributor prospects. Their arc is: **Disruption â†’ Possibility â†’ Economics â†’ Safety.**

```
TOP:    "They understand my problem" (pain validated)
MIDDLE: "This model could change my business" (alternative presented)
BOTTOM: "And they'll make sure I succeed" (risk removed)
```

- Hero: Provocative truth about their current model
- Body: The alternative model with enough specificity to be credible
- Economics: Revenue scenarios, margin comparisons, concrete numbers
- Protection: Guarantees that remove the risk of switching
- CTA: High-value exchange ("Discovery call," "Download economics brief")

### 3.4 Partner Product Page Arc (2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3)

These pages are unique: the product is framed through the lens of *what you can sell*, not *what it does*.

```
TOP:    "Here's a gap in your portfolio" (market positioning)
MIDDLE: "Here's what you'll sell and to whom" (capabilities, partner-framed)
BOTTOM: "Here's the revenue opportunity" (deal size, margin, timeline)
```

- Hero: Competitive positioning (e.g., "Enterprise ERP Without the Enterprise Price Tag")
- Capabilities: Written for the partner, not the end user â€” what the partner needs to know to sell it
- Opportunity: Specific â€” target segment, average deal size range, implementation timeline
- CTA: "Add this to your portfolio" tone, not "buy this product"

### 3.5 Economics Page Arc (2.3)

This page must feel like opening a spreadsheet, not reading a brochure.

```
TOP:    "Let's talk numbers" (signal: this page is concrete)
MIDDLE: "Here's how the math works" (revenue model, margin comparison)
LOWER:  "Here's how you're protected" (guarantees, territory, support)
BOTTOM: "Here's your growth path" (4-stage maturity) + CTA
```

- Every claim must have a number or a scenario attached
- Ranges are acceptable (and preferred over exact figures that require HQ approval)
- The 4-stage maturity path addresses "but how do I get from here to there?"
- End with both a high-touch CTA (discovery call) and a self-serve CTA (download brief)

### 3.6 News/Events Page Arc

Arc: Recognition â†’ Interest â†’ Registration

```
TOP:    "This is where it happens" (visitor sees active, relevant events)
MIDDLE: "This one's for me" (visitor identifies a relevant event type/topic)
BOTTOM: "I don't want to miss this" (visitor registers or subscribes)
```

- Hero: Signal activity and relevance â€” "Where Manufacturing Intelligence Meets Action"
- Featured event: Urgency through specificity (date, topic, limited seats)
- Event grid: Color-coded types help self-selection (Seminar, Workshop, Factory Visit, Trade Show)
- Event series: Monthly campaign progression creates "I should follow this" feeling
- CTA: Low-friction email subscribe + direct contact option

### 3.7 Blog/Knowledge Base Page Arc

Arc: Curiosity â†’ Authority â†’ Trust â†’ Action

```
TOP:    "They actually know manufacturing" (category breadth signals expertise)
MIDDLE: "This goes deeper than marketing fluff" (technical depth earns respect)
BOTTOM: "I should talk to these people" (authority â†’ trust â†’ conversation)
```

- Hero: Position as knowledge resource, not sales content â€” "Manufacturing Intelligence, Shared"
- Featured article: Lead with the strongest proof-backed piece (BOI compliance = first feature)
- Category filters: Let visitors self-select into their pain area
- Deep dive library: Signal depth â€” these aren't 500-word SEO pieces
- CTA: Bridge from learning to conversation â€” "Have a Manufacturing Challenge? Let's Talk"

### 3.8 Blog Article Arcs (by Funnel Stage)

Not all articles serve the same purpose. A top-of-funnel awareness piece and a bottom-of-funnel decision piece need different emotional arcs and CTA strategies. The generic arc (Problem â†' Depth â†' Proof â†' CTA) is preserved as the foundation, but each funnel stage adjusts the emphasis and exit strategy.

**Shared article design rules (all stages):**
- Headline: Always a problem or question the reader recognizes â€" never a product name
- Body: Max-width 800px for readability, Lexend headings, Source Sans 3 body at 18px/1.8
- Pull quotes: Blue left border (#3798E4), used for key insights
- Data callouts: JetBrains Mono, large numbers, dark background cards
- Related articles: 3-card grid at bottom to keep readers in the knowledge ecosystem

#### 3.8.1 TOFU Article Arc (Awareness)

Arc: Recognition â†' Education â†' Curiosity â†' Next Step

```
TOP:    "Yes, I deal with this exact problem" (pain naming)
MIDDLE: "I didn't know there was a framework for this" (educational value)
LOWER:  "This company clearly understands manufacturing" (authority earned)
BOTTOM: "Let me read another article" (soft CTA â†' related article or product overview)
```

CTA tone: Zero pressure. Reader should leave feeling smarter, not sold to.
CTA example: "Want to see how this applies to your industry? [See automotive manufacturing â†']"

#### 3.8.2 MOFU Article Arc (Consideration)

Arc: Problem Recognition â†' Technical Depth â†' Proof â†' Bridge

```
TOP:    "This is the specific gap in my current system" (technical pain)
MIDDLE: "Here's how a proper system handles this" (capability demonstration)
LOWER:  "And here's proof it works" (case data, competitive comparison)
BOTTOM: "I should see their product page" (bridge CTA â†' product/industry page)
```

CTA tone: Confident, specific. Points to a concrete "see how" rather than "talk to us."
CTA example: "This co-product capability comes standard in T100 and iGP. [See our ERP features â†']"

#### 3.8.3 BOFU Article Arc (Decision)

Arc: Validation â†' Risk Removal â†' Social Proof â†' Action

```
TOP:    "Other factories my size have this problem too" (normalization)
MIDDLE: "The implementation risk is lower than I feared" (fear neutralization)
LOWER:  "Real factories, real numbers, real outcomes" (heavy proof)
BOTTOM: "I'm ready to have a conversation" (direct CTA â†' demo.html)
```

CTA tone: Calm, action-oriented. The reader has earned their confidence; respect it.
CTA example: "Have questions about how this works in your factory? Let's Talk."

### 3.9 Track B Blog Article Arc (Partner/Distributor Content)

Arc: Provocation â†' Opportunity â†' Evidence â†' Invitation

```
TOP:    "The current model isn't sustainable" (business model disruption)
MIDDLE: "Here's what smart operators are doing differently" (alternative model)
LOWER:  "And the economics actually work" (revenue scenarios)
BOTTOM: "Explore the partner program" (CTA â†' partner-program.html)
```

CTA tone: Strategic, peer-to-peer. Speak to a business owner, not a salesperson.
CTA example: "See the full economics of a DigiWin partnership â€" including territory protection and margin structure."

New Blog Category: **"Partner Insights"** (#0EA5E9 teal-blue)
- Track B content lives in its own category
- Visible in blog listing alongside Track A categories
- Provides dedicated entry point for distributor prospects browsing the blog

### 3.10 Event Detail Page Arc

Arc: Curiosity → Relevance → Urgency → Action

```
TOP:    "This event is about MY problem" (instant relevance via pain naming)
UPPER:  "I'll walk out able to do THIS" (concrete outcomes, not vague agenda)
MIDDLE: "It's structured and professional" (agenda + proof remove 'sales pitch' fear)
LOWER:  "People like me will be there" (self-selection via persona cards)
BOTTOM: "I need to act now — seats are limited" (urgency + frictionless registration)
```

**Event type differentiation — each type promises a different value:**
- **Seminar** = knowledge: "Learn why..." — attendees leave understanding a framework or regulatory requirement
- **Workshop** = hands-on skill: "Walk out able to..." — attendees leave with a capability they didn't have before
- **Factory Visit** = proof: "See it running..." — attendees leave having witnessed a live system in a real factory
- **Trade Show** = presence: "Find us at..." — attendees leave with a face-to-face connection and materials

**Urgency/scarcity patterns for events:**
- Capacity limits: "Limited to 30 participants" (workshops), "15 spots available" (factory visits)
- Specific dates: Concrete date/time removes "I'll do it later" thinking
- Regulatory deadlines: "BOI audits are annual — your next one is approaching" (for compliance events)
- Series progression: "This is Month 1 of 4 — start from the beginning"

**Objection scripts for events:**

| Objection | Where Addressed | Neutralization |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| "Is this a vendor sales pitch?" | Section 2 (Problem) + Section 4 (Agenda) | Frame as education, show practical takeaways. Agenda proves structure. "You'll leave with a reconciliation checklist, not a sales deck." |
| "Is it worth half a day?" | Section 3 (Outcomes) | Concrete outcomes, not vague promises. "You'll be able to run a BOI reconciliation report" not "BOI overview presentation." |
| "Will people like me be there?" | Section 5 (Who Should Attend) | Persona-based self-selection. Reader sees their role, factory size, and challenge described. |
| "What if I can't make it?" | Section 8 (CTA) | "Can't make this date? Register your interest and we'll notify you of the next session." |

## 4. Objection-Handling Scripts

Every fear from the PRD's Fear Inventory (Section 2.3) is mapped here with a reusable neutralization pattern: **Name it â†’ Reframe it â†’ Prove it.**

The rule: objection handling is woven into page copy â€” never in a standalone "FAQ" section. When a visitor encounters the answer to their unspoken fear naturally within the narrative, it feels like the company "just gets it."

### 4.1 Factory Owner & Operator Objections

**Objection 1: "Implementation will disrupt production"**

- **Where:** 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 (product pages), 4.x (industry pages)
- **Name it:** "The #1 fear isn't cost â€” it's downtime."
- **Reframe:** "DigiWin implementations run in parallel. Your production never stops. Our phased approach means we go live module by module, not big-bang."
- **Prove it:** Implementation timeline visual showing parallel run. Case study metric: "Deployed across 3 lines in 12 weeks while maintaining 98% on-time delivery."

**Objection 2: "We tried ERP before and it failed"**

- **Where:** 1.0 (Home), 3.0 (Products Hub), 4.x (Industry pages)
- **Name it:** "If your last ERP failed, it probably wasn't built for manufacturing."
- **Reframe:** "Generic ERPs treat a factory like an office. Manufacturing ERP speaks BOMs, routings, work orders, and OEE â€” natively."
- **Prove it:** Case study from a factory that replaced a failed generic ERP with DigiWin. Before/after metrics.

**Objection 3: "We'll be locked into a vendor"**

- **Where:** 3.0 (Products Hub), Home Section 5 (DigiWin Difference)
- **Name it:** "Your ERP should grow with you, not hold you hostage."
- **Reframe:** "DigiWin's product ladder â€” iGP â†’ T100 â†’ MES â†’ WMS â†’ AIoT â€” means you upgrade within the ecosystem. Your investment compounds, never resets."
- **Prove it:** Growth path diagram. Case study of a company that started with iGP and scaled.

**Objection 4: "My team can't learn a new system"**

- **Where:** 3.x (product pages), 5.2 (About Us â€” Section 7)
- **Name it:** "A system your team won't use is worse than no system at all."
- **Reframe:** "50+ Thai staff. 60%+ bilingual. Training in Thai, support in Thai. Your operators learn on their terms."
- **Prove it:** Thai-language UI screenshots. Training program details. Team composition stats.

**Objection 5: "It's too expensive for our size"**

- **Where:** 3.1 (ERP Core â€” iGP section), Home Section 3 (Value Props)
- **Name it:** "Enterprise pricing doesn't belong in an SME factory."
- **Reframe:** "iGP is purpose-built for 20-200 employee factories. Not enterprise software scaled down â€” SME software built up."
- **Prove it:** ROI scenario: "Typical iGP client sees ROI within 12 months through reduced inventory waste and improved scheduling accuracy." No exact pricing (requires HQ).

### 4.2 Distributor Prospect Objections

**Objection 1: "DigiWin will compete with me for clients"**

- **Where:** 2.0 (Partner Hub), 2.3 (Partner Economics)
- **Name it:** "The #1 reason partner programs fail: the vendor becomes your competitor."
- **Reframe:** "DigiWin's direct team serves Taiwanese/Chinese companies. The Thai local market is partner-only. By structure, not by promise."
- **Prove it:** Explicit guarantee. Structural explanation of market segmentation. "Zero channel conflict" as a headline, not a footnote.

**Objection 2: "The product is too complex for my team"**

- **Where:** 2.2 (Solution Stack), 2.3 (Partner Economics)
- **Name it:** "You don't need to be a DigiWin expert on Day 1."
- **Reframe:** "Our 4-stage maturity path starts with co-implementation. DigiWin engineers work alongside your team."
- **Prove it:** The 4 stages with timelines:
  1. **Filter** (Month 1-2): DigiWin qualifies leads, partner observes
  2. **Empower** (Month 3-6): DigiWin leads implementation, partner supports
  3. **Pilot** (Month 6-12): Partner leads, DigiWin supports
  4. **Independent** (Year 2+): Partner delivers fully, DigiWin provides product support

**Objection 3: "My clients won't switch from SAP/Oracle"**

- **Where:** 2.2.3 (AIoT & MES), 2.2 (Solution Stack)
- **Name it:** "Nobody's asking them to rip and replace."
- **Reframe:** "The reverse cut: enter through MES alongside existing ERP, prove shop floor ROI, expand into ERP when the client is ready."
- **Prove it:** Reverse cut diagram. MES as non-threatening entry point â†’ data dependency â†’ full ERP migration.

**Objection 4: "The margins won't be better"**

- **Where:** 2.3 (Partner Economics â€” core content), 2.1 (Business Model Crisis)
- **Name it:** "If the math doesn't work, nothing else matters."
- **Reframe:** "Three revenue streams: implementation (project fees), license (one-time or recurring), maintenance (annual annuity). Man-day revenue is linear. Product-led revenue compounds."
- **Prove it:** Year 1-2-3 scenario table. Margin comparison vs. current model. Emphasis on compounding recurring revenue.

**Objection 5: "They won't understand the Thai market"**

- **Where:** 2.0 (Partner Hub), 5.2 (About Us)
- **Name it:** "Fair question."
- **Reframe:** "8 years in Thailand. 50+ Thai staff. 60%+ bilingual. 100+ implementations. Thai-registered company with Thai majority ownership. We don't need to understand the Thai market â€” we're in it."
- **Prove it:** Stats banner. Team photo. Bangkok office. Thai client logos.

### 4.3 BOI Compliance Objection Script

**Objection 6: "BOI compliance is handled by our accountant"**

- **Where:** 3.1 (ERP), 4.x (Industry pages), Blog (BOI article)
- **Name it:** "BOI compliance isn't an accounting problem â€” it's a production data problem."
- **Reframe:** "When the BOI board audits your factory, they compare what you imported against what you produced â€” down to the production order level. If your ERP uses theoretical BOM calculations, the numbers will never match actual consumption. The supplementary tax bill is the gap between theory and reality."
- **Prove it:** Jin Hai case study: 10M+ THB/year in supplementary taxes â†’ zero after DigiWin's production-order-based reconciliation. "Almost 100% of new manufacturing entrants have BOI certificates. This isn't a nice-to-have â€” it's existential."

**Objection 7: "We already have Kingdee/Yonyou/SAP"**

- **Where:** 3.1 (ERP), Blog (competitive articles)
- **Name it:** "The question isn't whether your current ERP works. The question is what it can't do."
- **Reframe:** "Can it handle co-product cost allocation â€” one work order producing multiple outputs with accurate cost distribution? Can it run capacity planning without a separate APS system? Can it show both kilograms and pieces simultaneously? These aren't edge cases in Thai manufacturing â€” they're daily reality."
- **Prove it:** Feature comparison table (7 weapons). Link to relevant blog articles for technical depth.
- **Note:** This objection uses Track B rules for competitor naming (acceptable for technical comparison). On Track A pages, use "Unlike other ERPs" framing instead of naming specific competitors.

## 5. Proof Formatting Guidelines

### 5.1 Proof Escalation by Page Depth

| Page Type | Proof Level | What to Use |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Hub pages (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0) | Light | Stats + logo bar + capability claims |
| Mid-funnel leaves (2.1, 2.2, 3.x) | Medium | Problemâ†’Solution pairs + case study snippets |
| Conversion leaves (2.3, 4.x, 5.1) | Heavy | Full case studies + testimonials + ROI scenarios + guarantees |

### 5.2 Stats Formatting

- Use the actual number: "44 years" not "over 40 years"
- Large numbers get comma separators: "50,000+"
- Every number gets a context label: "50,000+ Manufacturing Clients Worldwide"
- "+" suffix signals ongoing growth
- Stock code 300378 always presented as trust signal
- Stats banners: dark background (#253B50), white text, large font, counter animation

### 5.3 Case Study Structure

```
[Company Industry] manufacturer in [Location]

Challenge: [1-2 sentences â€” the specific manufacturing problem]
Solution: [1-2 sentences â€” which DigiWin products were deployed]
Results:  [2-3 measurable metrics with before â†’ after]
Timeline: [Implementation duration]
```

Rules:
- Minimum 2 measurable metrics
- Always include implementation timeline
- Industry must match the page it appears on
- If no real case study available: use composite scenario clearly labeled "representative example based on typical DigiWin implementations"

### 5.4 Testimonial Structure

```
"[1-2 sentence quote â€” specific outcome, never generic praise]"
â€” [Full Name], [Title], [Company]
```

Rules:
- If no real testimonials available yet: use stat-based proof as placeholder
- Never fabricate quotes
- Place near CTAs â€” testimonials reduce friction at the decision moment

## 6. CTA Language & Hierarchy

### 6.1 Commitment Ladder

| Level | CTA Type | Track A Examples | Track B Examples |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 (Browse) | Bridge | "See Our Solutions" | "Explore the Partner Model" |
| 2 (Self-Serve) | Download | "Download Product Guide" | "Download Partner Economics Brief" |
| 3 (Low-Touch) | Assessment | "Request a Free Assessment" | "See the Revenue Calculator" |
| 4 (High-Touch) | Conversation | "Talk to Our Team" | "Schedule a Discovery Call" |
| 5 (Conversion) | Action | "Let's Talk" | "Become a Partner" |

### 6.2 CTA Rules

- Every page ends with exactly one primary CTA
- Bridge CTAs appear mid-page to move visitors to the next page in sequence
- Never use "Submit" â€” always action language: "Send My Request," "Get My Assessment"
- Track A CTAs emphasize low risk: "free," "no obligation," "see for yourself"
- Track B CTAs emphasize exclusivity: "discovery call" (not sales call), "explore the partnership"
- Shared pages (Home, About Us): always show dual CTAs â€” "Let's Talk" + "Become a Partner"

### 6.3 CTA Visual Standards

- Primary: #3798E4 background, white text, rounded corners
- Secondary: white background, #3798E4 border and text (ghost button)
- CTA banner sections: #253B50 or #F5F7FA background, full-width
- Button text: 16-18px, bold, sentence case
- Mobile: full-width buttons, minimum 48px tap target

## 7. Page-Specific Copywriting Notes

### 7.1 Home (1.0) â€” The 5-Second Rule

- Hero copy: 5-7 words per panel maximum
- No jargon â€” a factory manager and a consulting firm owner must both instantly self-identify
- Split-screen visual does the heavy lifting; copy supports
- Below hero, content serves both audiences until Industry Selector (Track A only)

### 7.2 Partner Program Hub (2.0) â€” Highest Persuasion Load

- Headline must create cognitive dissonance: "Stop Selling Man-Days" challenges identity
- Pain Point Trio uses distributor's own internal language
- Product growth ladder visual is the single most important image on the site
- Social proof: stock code + client count matter more than individual logos for this audience

### 7.3 Business Model Crisis (2.1) â€” Empathy First

- "We've seen this pattern" not "you're doing it wrong"
- Side-by-side comparison should feel like discovery, not accusation
- End with possibility: "See how the math changes" â€” invitation, not push

### 7.4 Partner Economics (2.3) â€” Spreadsheet Energy

- Feels like opening a spreadsheet, not reading a brochure
- Ranges over exact figures (HQ pricing approval required for specifics)
- Year 1-2-3 scenarios: conservative and credible â€” overpromising kills trust here
- 4-stage maturity path includes concrete deliverables at each stage, not abstract "support"

### 7.5 Industry Pages (4.1-4.3) â€” Speak Their Dialect

- **Automotive:** JIT, EDI, mold lifecycle, customer portal â€” table-stakes terms
- **Electronics:** SMT, component traceability, yield calculation, RoHS â€” if these are missing, trust is gone
- **Metal & Plastics:** Dual-unit (kgâ†’PCS), scrap tracking, material yield, die management â€” think materials and waste

### 7.6 About Us (5.2) â€” The Due Diligence Page

- Timeline (1982-present) builds trust through longevity
- Stats banner: most visually impactful element â€” large numbers, dark background, counter animation
- "Because of DigiWin" section pivots from company story to visitor benefit
- Thailand story (Section 7) directly addresses "will they understand Thai market?" â€” must feel authentic

### 7.7 News/Events (6.0) â€” Activity Signals Trust

- Event types convey different value: Seminars (knowledge), Workshops (hands-on), Factory Visits (proof), Trade Shows (industry presence)
- Color-coding helps instant scanning â€” blue/green/amber/purple for four types
- "Manufacturing Competitiveness Series" frames events as a coherent campaign, not random occurrences
- Past events section shows track record â€” "they do this regularly"
- Never show an empty events page â€” always have at least placeholder content with "Registration Opening Soon"

### 7.8 Blog/Knowledge Base (7.0) â€” Technical Authority

- Articles must earn respect in the first paragraph â€” no marketing fluff opening
- Every article should reference at least one specific manufacturing scenario the reader recognizes
- Categories map to pain areas, not product names: "BOI & Compliance" not "T100 Features"
- Article length: 1,200-2,000 words for authority pieces, 600-800 for quick guides
- Internal linking: every article should link to at least one related article and one product page
- Source intelligence: Eddie's presale methodology translates directly to content â€" the 5 universal pain points are the 5 content pillars

### 7.9 In-Article CTA Strategy

Blog articles use a three-tier CTA system. The tiers escalate from soft (learning-oriented) to direct (conversion-oriented). No article uses all three mid-article â€" the bottom banner is always present, but mid-article CTAs are selective.

**Tier 1 â€" Soft CTA (Mid-Article)**
- Placement: After 2nd or 3rd H2 section (~40-60% scroll depth)
- Style: `blog-highlight` box (light blue bg, blue left border, no button)
- Tone: Extends learning, doesn't interrupt it
- Example: "If BOI compliance is your primary concern, see how DigiWin's ERP handles production-order-level reconciliation â†'"
- Use on: TOFU and MOFU articles

**Tier 2 â€" Bridge CTA (Post-Proof)**
- Placement: After a case study mention, data card, or competitive comparison
- Style: White card with category-color accent, headline + 1 sentence + link
- Tone: Confident, specific â€" "see how this works"
- Example: "This capability comes standard in both T100 and iGP. Explore ERP Features â†'"
- Use on: MOFU articles only

**Tier 3 â€" Direct CTA (Bottom)**
- Placement: Bottom of every article (existing pattern)
- Style: Dark gradient banner with "Let's Talk" (existing)
- Enhancement: Add secondary CTA "Exploring a Partnership?" â†' partner-program.html (only on articles that mention distributor/partner content)

**Anti-Salesy Guardrails:**
1. Never use "Learn More" â€" say what the reader will see
2. Never interrupt mid-paragraph â€" place at natural section breaks
3. Never repeat the same CTA twice in one article
4. Max 2 CTAs above the bottom banner (1 soft + 1 bridge)
5. Frame as reader's choice: "If you want to explore..." not "Contact us to..."

### 7.10 Event Detail Pages (6.1) — Conversion Through Specificity

Event detail pages convert curiosity into registration. The key insight: specificity removes uncertainty, and uncertainty kills registration.

**Pain-first, not agenda-first:**
- Open with the problem the event solves, not a description of the event
- "Your finance team spends 3 weeks preparing for each BOI audit" not "Join our BOI compliance workshop"
- The reader must feel the relevance before they'll invest their time

**Outcome language over topic language:**
- "You'll walk out able to run a BOI reconciliation report" not "BOI compliance presentation"
- "You'll see a live factory dashboard tracking 12 machines" not "MES demonstration"
- Every agenda item starts with what the attendee gains, not what the speaker covers

**Persona cards for self-selection:**
- "Who Should Attend" section uses cards matching reader's identity: role + factory size + challenge
- Reader should see themselves in at least one card
- If none match, they self-select out — which is fine (quality > quantity)

**Inline objection handling:**
- "Is this a sales pitch?" → addressed in Section 2 (Problem) + Section 4 (Agenda) — structure proves substance
- "Is it worth my time?" → addressed in Section 3 (Outcomes) — concrete deliverables, not vague benefits
- NO standalone FAQ section. Objections woven into narrative flow.

**Registration CTA strategy:**
- Hero has "Register Now" + quick-facts bar (date/time/location/seats) — no scrolling needed to act
- Bottom CTA repeats with urgency recap: remaining seats, date reminder
- Secondary: "Can't make this date?" captures interest for future events
- All registration links to demo.html (contact form)

## 8. Content Formulas

Reusable structures for Content Specs.

### 8.1 Hero Formula

```
[Headline: 5-10 words, bold, active]
[Subhead: 15-20 words, expands on headline]
[CTA: 3-5 words, action-oriented]
```

### 8.2 Pain-Point Card Formula

```
[Pain name: 2-4 words, bold]
[One sentence: the pain in visitor's language]
[One sentence: hint at the alternative]
```

### 8.3 Problem â†’ Solution Pair Formula

```
[Problem: one sentence starting with observable pain]
â†’
[Solution: one sentence starting with DigiWin capability + outcome]
```

### 8.4 Case Study Snippet Formula

```
[Industry] manufacturer in [Location] â€” [Key metric] within [Timeframe]
```

### 8.5 Bridge CTA Formula

```
[Action verb] + [what they'll see/get] â†’ links to [specific page]
```

## 9. Translation & Localization Notes

### 9.1 Principles

- Translate meaning, not words â€” Thai business register is less direct than English
- Manufacturing terms often stay in English on Thai factory floors: OEE, BOM, MRP, MES, FIFO, JIT, EDI
- Formal register (à¸„à¸£à¸±à¸š/à¸„à¹ˆà¸°) in CTAs and forms
- Product names stay in English: T100, iGP, sMES, SFT, sFLS
- "DigiWin" stays in English; é¼Žæ–° in parentheses for Chinese-reading audiences

### 9.2 Key Headlines to Transcreate (Not Just Translate)

These headlines rely on English rhythm and should be culturally adapted for Thai:
- "Stop Selling Man-Days. Start Selling Manufacturing Outcomes."
- "Stop Guessing. Start Seeing."
- "Every Item. Every Location. Every Time."
- "The Man-Day Trap"

Flag these in Content Specs when they appear.

## 10. Anti-Patterns

What DigiWin copy must never do:

1. **Sound generic.** If "SAP" could replace "DigiWin" and the sentence still works â€” rewrite it.
2. **Lead with features.** Always outcomes first. "See all factories in one dashboard" not "multi-entity consolidated financials module."
3. **Name competitors on Track A pages.** Track A (factory operators): use "unlike other ERPs" framing â€” let the reader fill in the name. Track B (distributors/partners): naming competitors is acceptable because distributors need specific competitive positioning to evaluate the opportunity (e.g., "SAP ECC end-of-life 2027," "Kingdee can't handle co-products"). Blog technical articles may name competitors when making specific, factual technical comparisons.
4. **Use fear on factory owners or operators.** Empathize, then solve. "You're not alone" not "you're losing money."
5. **Make unsubstantiated claims.** Every claim needs a number, a case study, or a structural truth.
6. **Shout.** Maximum 3 exclamation marks across the entire 20-page site.
7. **Write walls of text.** Max 3 sentences per paragraph. Manufacturing buyers scan.
8. **Frame the Partner Program as distribution.** It's a business transformation opportunity â€” about their growth, not our reach.

## 11. Eddie's Presale Methodology â€” Website Application

The presale training transcripts reveal a proven methodology for engaging Thai manufacturers. These principles translate directly to website content:

### 11.1 "Never Open the ERP" â†’ Never Lead with Features

Eddie's #1 rule: never open the ERP system in a demo presentation. The website equivalent: never lead a page or section with feature lists or system screenshots. Instead:
- Lead with the manufacturing pain point the visitor recognizes
- Show the outcome (what changes in their daily operation)
- Only then introduce the capability that makes it possible

### 11.2 Story-Driven Discovery â†’ Case Studies Before Product Pages

Eddie trains presales to tell industry stories that resonate before asking about requirements. Website equivalent:
- Blog articles and case studies should be entry points, not afterthoughts
- Every industry page should open with a story a factory owner recognizes
- Product pages should be destinations visitors arrive at after their pain has been named

### 11.3 Five Universal Pain Points = Five Content Pillars

From presale training, every Thai manufacturer shares these pains:
1. **Cost Opacity** â€” "Do you know your real production cost per batch?" â†’ Content pillar: Cost Management
2. **Production Transparency** â€” "Can you see your shop floor right now?" â†’ Content pillar: Smart Factory
3. **Paper-Based Fraud** â€” "Are your production reports accurate, or just on time?" â†’ Content pillar: Production Planning
4. **Planning vs. Reality** â€” "How often does your plan survive contact with the shop floor?" â†’ Content pillar: Production Planning
5. **Delivery Accuracy** â€” "When your customer calls, can you answer in 10 seconds?" â†’ Content pillar: Industry Insights

These map directly to blog categories and product page pain-point sections.

### 11.4 Top-Down Messaging

Eddie: "Always reach the boss first." Website equivalent:
- Hero copy speaks to owner/MD concerns (competitiveness, margins, growth, succession)
- Operator-level detail (OEE dashboards, scheduling screens) appears below the fold
- CTA language assumes the reader is a decision-maker: "Let's Talk" not "Ask Your Manager"

### 11.5 Manufacturing Language Glossary

From presale training, terms the audience uses and expects:
- **Shop floor** (not "production environment")
- **Work order** (not "production order" for Thai audience)
- **Yield rate** (not "efficiency metric")
- **Scrap** (not "waste" â€” too generic)
- **Back-flush** (material consumption method â€” expected in MES discussion)
- **Kanban** (visual scheduling â€” universally understood on Thai factory floors)
- **OEE** (Overall Equipment Effectiveness â€” the KPI every production manager knows)
- **BOM explosion** (breaking a finished product into component materials)
